        <title>Three Systems Theory Approaches to API Governance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When there is more than one team in an organization, things need to be coordinated. This is especially true when it comes to organizations seeking consistent API design despite have those designs having different authors. Developers, designers, architects, and product managers &lt;em&gt;intuit&lt;/em&gt; that consistent design helps them achieve greater speed and scale. Further, a common approach makes integration more intuitive and can reduce ongoing support costs. But getting teams aligned is a whole separate, more significant challenge when compared to just creating the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social scientist couple, Fred and Merrelyn Emery, identified two basic patterns for coordinating activities across multiple teams. They named them “&lt;em&gt;first design principle&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;second design principle&lt;/em&gt;”, or &lt;em&gt;DP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;DP2&lt;/em&gt;, respectively. Later, they added the concept of the &lt;em&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/em&gt; organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/08/dp1-and-dp2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Emery's depecition of DP1 and DP2 organizations.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;The Emerys' depecition of DP1 and DP2 organizations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laissez-fair-governance&quot;&gt;Laissez-fair Governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laissez-faire is defined as the absence of design principles. Nearly all API ecosystems start as laissez-faire. API design is not a coordinated activity in the beginning but rather a technical means-to-an-end. Laissez-faire is understandable, even desirable at this point in an organization’s journey. An organization’s culture and context define a significant amount of the unique pain points that emerge from inconsistent approaches; these can be difficult to predict. Further, if the API ecosystem does not require further scaling or evolution beyond fragmented, random one-off efforts, a laissez-faire approach to consistency may be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dp1-governance&quot;&gt;DP1 Governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given the necessity of APIs to value delivery in digital transformation efforts, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; businesses &lt;strong&gt;can’t stop with just laissez-faire design approaches&lt;/strong&gt;. In these cases, leadership will establish a DP1 organizational structure; they’ll introduce a manager or supervisor whose explicit job is to coordinate parts to achieve an outcome. In API design, the role of this “API reviewer” or “Center of Excellence” group is to achieve greater consistency for the interfaces produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, responsibility for achieving a quality outcome is straightforward. A single, highly-trained individual (or group) could apply to an entire domain. Ownership of the improvement activities is clear; activities like problem assessment, activity creation, oversite, progress reporting, and feedback gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other, DP1 implementations of governance also have notable downsides. For one thing, it can be difficult for any person from a single discipline (architecture, engineering, etc.) to also excel in the  myriad of additional skills this type of oversite requires. These skills include diplomacy, consensus-building, project management, and influencing with minimal formal authority, in addition to having a rich and deep understanding of API nuance. Career progression for these diamonds-in-the-rough people is also unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For development teams, especially for those used to a laissez-faire design approach, the introduction of this new supervisor or group can be met with hesitation, even suspicion. They may feel a loss of autonomy or lowered morale over what they perceive as a condemnation of their past work. When the relationship is strained and feedback loops poor, the introduction of this design leadership comes across as “ivory tower architecture”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these DP1 organizational environments that spring to mind when we hear the word “governance”: bureaucratic, dictatorial, and process-heavy hierarchies. These &lt;em&gt;worst-case&lt;/em&gt; scenarios cause individuals to feel robbed of agency without the opportunity of recourse. Not everything is worse-case, of course. The most common case is ineffectual, flaccid governance: governance that is tolerated during the production of a token wins. However, the overall API program/platform cannot deliver on the grand transformation promised at the onset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dp2-governance&quot;&gt;DP2 Governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a DP2 approach, regulation of design standards (and subsequent quality outcomes) is built into the teams themselves. Individuals are expected to manage the coordination across their boundaries. For example, when designing an error object, Ramesh would consult with his peer on another team, Tara. Tara would have experience creating something similar from her work with Maria and Jose who, likewise, are assigned to other teams. And so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with Brooks’ Law might notice their Spider-sense tingling. Putting the onus to “carry water” on individuals creates significant communication overhead, particularly as the number of people required to coordinate increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/08/brooks-law.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture depicting the increasing lines of communication described by Brooks' Law.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;A picture depicting the increasing lines of communication described by Brooks' Law.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is one approach to lessen the amount of communication required.   “If everyone just &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; what to do,” the thinking goes, “they’ll have more time to just do it”. With ongoing effort, this approach can work. However, “upskilling” every individual across all the organization’s development teams is also not trivial. A business pursuing this course of action is also likely to appoint someone or some group to oversee this upskilling, which puts us back into the DP1 design camp. The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://rayli.net/posts/information-action-fallacy/&quot;&gt;information action fallacy&lt;/a&gt;” also looms large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the environment to make desired outcomes more likely is also an approach. I’ll talk more about this in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the number and complexity of API ecosystems increase, we also need to increase the sophistication of our scaling approaches. Thankfully, a tremendous body of sociotechnical and systems theory over the decades addresses exactly that. As stewards of those ecosystems, our challenge is to step outside of our previous professional callings and engage with this new (to us) wisdom. The sooner we can do that, the sooner we can deliver on the promise of distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Way to Improve API Guidance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen my share of API Design guidelines. I’ve even contributed to a few. Consistent across those style guides, standards documents, and requirements pages is that we crafted them without the benefit of technical writing or information architecture professionals. Despite having the best of intentions, we left opportunities for conveying our design expectations in better and more useful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One simple yet powerful addition to any design requirements page is the inclusion of examples &lt;em&gt;formatting in the company’s schema of choice&lt;/em&gt;. These examples can be easily copied/pasted and modified in the editor of choice, removing the ambiguity of personal interpretation or possible typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/08/on-examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a slide from 2018 commenting on the importance of examples from Jasmine Mithani.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at what I mean. Here is a hypothetical example of an API rule a business might adopt for interface consistency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pagination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When retrieving a collection of similar items, a caller may desire only to retrieve a subset. The caller may also need the ability to progress through subsets. To paginate through a collection, an API SHOULD provide a pair of query parameters: &lt;strong&gt;limit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;offset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is solid guidance and a step toward encouraging APIs that behave more consistently within a domain. However, even within that tiny snippet, several nuanced elements need to be translated correctly to an OpenAPI’s YAML. We also assume that developers are well versed in YAML conventions. In my experience, OpenAPI is a means to an end, not a topic of voluntary study and application. As a result, whoever is writing the API description writes just enough to get their description to validate against the OpenAPI schema and moves on. This &lt;em&gt;minimum viable description&lt;/em&gt; checks a box but falls short of &lt;em&gt;being good enough for integrators&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;paths:
    /users:
        get:
            responses:
                '200':
                description: success
            parameters:
                - $ref: &quot;#components/limit&quot;
                - $ref: &quot;#components/offset&quot;
components:
    schemas:
        limit:
            description: the limit
        offset:
            description: the offset
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing an API describing pagination this way meets the &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt; of the rule, it fails to demonstrate the &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;lowering comprehension overhead&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of doing the right thing lies with the API designer. But the guidelines, by providing examples that can be copy/pasted, can do a tremendous amount to make that job more manageable. If it was the dev team creating APIs, the benefit is limited. Ten? Now we see some benefit. Dozens of teams across a company? At that scale, the consistency and speed possible by copy/pasting fully realized guidance directly into a design begins to add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after the description of the pagination guidelines above, include an example that they can easily copy, paste, and customize into their own work, like below. Then continue for each and every other API design feature that would benefit from a more consistent approach. &lt;em&gt;Those writing API descriptions will thank you for it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;paths:
    /users:
        get:
            responses:
                '200':
                description: success
            parameters:
                - name: offset
                    in: query
                    required: false
                    description: The index of the first item to retrieve. Indices are zero-based
                    schema: 
                        type: integer
                        format: int32
                        minimum: 0
                        default: 0
                - name: limit
                    in: query
                    required: false
                    description: The number of items to retrieve at once. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;insert API-specific default here, including if there is a maximum value&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
                    schema: 
                        type: integer
                        format: int32
                        minimum: 1
                        maximum: 1000
                        default: 20

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Machine Learning Prompts Within IDEs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous posts, I’ve discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/25/ArchitectureIsLaw/&quot;&gt;how one’s environment impacts behavior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/30/TemplatesAsPrompts/&quot;&gt;how defaults and templates are part of a software development environment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/07/14/WhatShouldBeInATemplate/&quot;&gt;possible behavioral prompts to consider in an OpenAPI template&lt;/a&gt;. But what do irresponsible or counter-productive environmental prompts look like? The recent kerfuffle over &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://copilot.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github’s Copilot AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a great example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/07/ide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture showing code on a computer screen.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@andreiamza2000&quot;&gt;Amza Andrei&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ide&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/net-api-notes-for-2021-07-07-issue-168-github-s-copilot&quot;&gt;I discussed Copilot in a recent edition of my API email newsletter, Net API Notes #168&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Copilot is an assistant for writing code. As a developer types in their Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Copilot suggests “whole lines or entire functions” learned from similar found across Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this seems like an example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/25/ArchitectureIsLaw/&quot;&gt;using the environment to prompt behavior&lt;/a&gt;. When it recognizes what the developer is attempting, Copilot prompts a solution similar to what others have done previously. Being the path of least resistance, the developer (particularly a junior one) is likely to accept the default provided and move on to their next task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, however, what &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt; is the environment optimizing for? Quality or convenience? If we consider how Copilot was trained, we begin to get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374&quot;&gt;a published paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NoraDotCodes/status/1412741339771461635&quot;&gt;subsequent tweets&lt;/a&gt;, it appears Copilot trained on all publicly available Github code. As someone who has contributed their share of broken, test, and experimental code to Github, I can guarantee that not everything publicly available follows best practices. Further, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/01/08/WhyAISuccessIsAPIBuilt/&quot;&gt;as I discussed in my overview on machine learning’s API future&lt;/a&gt;, Copilot’s algorithm can’t discern which common programmatic approaches are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, only those that have occurred historically. It then, subsequently, propagates those with its promptings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean in practice? As an industry (and with APIs specifically), software developers are still wrestling with comprehensive, security-minded practices. It should come as no surprise, then, that Copilot ends up prompting the same kinds of security flaws that have bedeviled the industry throughout the past. &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/devsecai-github-copilot-prone-to-writing-security-flaws&quot;&gt;A security researcher studying the issue says Copilot suggests&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“-bad code that looks reasonable at first glance, something that might slip by a programmer in a hurry, or seem correct to a less experienced coder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a more API-specific example, from the same article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The AI tool also ‘blundered right into the most classic security flaw of the early 2000s: a PHP script taking a raw GET variable and interpolating it into a string to be used as an SQL query, causing SQL injection’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to optimize a system for &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;. However, using machine-learning to create environmental prompts isn’t automatically value-adding activity. Designed poorly, it becomes the equivalent of throwing more spagehetti at the wall. When considering what behaviors an environment creates, don’t lose sight of the quality outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Prompts Should Be In an OpenAPI Tempate?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last piece, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/30/TemplatesAsPrompts/&quot;&gt;I talked about the importance of not overlooking the behavioral influence of software templates&lt;/a&gt;. The conclusion was that our output is influenced by our tools whether we consciously are aware of it or not. Therefore, we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; continue to trudge on in ignorance and wonder why things aren’t working out as intended. &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; we can design our environments to more easily achieve our governance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An OpenAPI description has become the most common way to express RESTful and RESTish API designs. As a result, a wide variety of API tooling presents an OpenAPI default to a developer beginning a new design. Unfortunately, this default is usually a lowest-common-denominator, stripped-down suggestion that does little to encourage company-common practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/prompt03.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the default OpenAPI template provided by Postman.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A picture of the default OpenAPI template provided by Postman.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of prompts could an API Center of Excellence/Enablement, API Governance, or enterprise architecture group consider putting in their default template?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;versioning&quot;&gt;Versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4002570-how-to-deliver-sustainable-apis&quot;&gt;In its research (paywalled, unfortunately)&lt;/a&gt;, Gartner identifies not one, not two, but &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; different ways an API could be versioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API Evolution, or only allowing for additions to an API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Root namespace URI versioning (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://api.example.com/v1/resource&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource-level URL versioning (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://api.example.com/resource/v1&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP content header versioning (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl -H &quot;Accepts-version:1.0&quot; https://api.example.com/resource&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP query parameter versioning (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://api.example.com/resource?version=1&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, there are even more ways to version an API than that!  And one way isn’t superior to another method. Yet, to manage the cognitive overhead of working with many APIs, it is important to create designs with consistent versioning behavior within a common domain, like an organization. A new member to that domain, when presented with a template, shouldn’t have to guess which approach is desired in their new context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenAPI template should demonstrate the versioning method preferred by the organization. It should not be up to the designer to recall best practices from a separate correspondence in order to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-descriptions&quot;&gt;Better Descriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, how many times have you been reading documentation, like that generated from an OpenAPI description, and you’ve come across something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: userId
description: the Id of the user
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that might be &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; correct, it is also the bare minimum way to describe an important piece of information. The writer might have not bothered with a description since it doesn’t convey much more than what could be gleaned from the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous role, we defined a series of characteristics that makes a compelling, worthwhile description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Characteristic&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Details&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Context&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Context Detailed business context explaining what the data stands for and its expected usage&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;“A userId represents individuals and business entities that either (1) have active accounts or (2) are in the pre-sales pipeline.”&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Proper Grammar &amp;amp; Complete Sentences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Definitions should start with the term being defined.&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;Information on source application, frequency of upload, and/or retention policy, if applicable.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;“Data is updated monthly for the entire customer population.”&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every field will require every characteristic. However, when it comes to the template presented to an API designer, we should provide examples that illustrate better, more complete information. If we give a designer a bare-bones, minimally worded OpenAPI description, they’re likely to continue that same approach in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As your API landscape grows, perhaps versioning or better field descriptions aren’t a primary concern. However, hopefully, these examples have sparked some ideas on how you might lean in on the issues that concern you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t have to end with just the templates. At the recently completed APIDays conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/D1vPdX2TdRI?t=901&quot;&gt;ADP’s Boris Vernoff demonstrated how their customized environments promote consistency within their design environments (screens begin around the 15-minute mark)&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than starting the design process with a blank page, a designer can select from a series of prompts. This ‘wizard’ approach does constrain the possibility space. However, in doing so, it directs energy to solve the unique business problem and away from introducing variance on non-value-adding API mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot that goes into creating APIs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2016/06/02/ConsistencyAndCohesion/&quot;&gt;greater consistency and cohesion&lt;/a&gt;. What is your environment doing to make that easier?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rethinking the Humble Template</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/25/ArchitectureIsLaw/&quot;&gt;I discussed how changing the environment could change people’s behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Further, I proposed that software tools are as much the environment as a developer’s office. Careful prompt design within those environments can create &lt;strong&gt;better behavioral outcomes&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;less effort&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;more buy-in&lt;/strong&gt;. But what does that look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stack-overflow-example&quot;&gt;The Stack Overflow Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; is a website where people ask questions for other people to answer. To remain viable, Stack Overflow desires certain behaviors from its audience. First of all, they aren’t interested in &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; but quality; poorly worded, vague, or duplicate questions aren’t welcome. You don’t go to Stack Overflow to idly chat. Further, they aren’t interested in lots of answers, only the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website’s environment goes to great lengths to prompt these sorts of behaviors. Before one is allowed to ask a question, a modal pop-up reminds the asker to search to see if their question has already been asked and how to ask if they can’t find a prior version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/prompt01.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the Stack Overflow modal prompt before posting a question.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I, subsequently begin a question, the interface immediately provides feedback as to whether it is worth posting, and any already existing questions. The process continues through the post body, with a host of prompts for specificity, uniqueness, and completeness. By exhibiting these behaviors, I’m more likely to get my question answered, and the site gets a valuable reference for the next person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/prompt02.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the Stack Overflow question interface.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stack Overflow still has moderators&lt;/strong&gt;. They do step in when necessary. But the amount of manual intervention they undertake is significantly less than if there were no environmental nudges toward behaviors beneficial for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-openapi-example&quot;&gt;The OpenAPI Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we should think of templates also as a prompt. When capturing business intent in an API specification, like OpenAPI, many tools present a bare-bones template. This template exists to help a new designer get started but often it is the most minimal valid version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/prompt03.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the default OpenAPI template provided by Postman..&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much potential here! Most companies I’m familiar with have some form of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/&quot;&gt;API style guide&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine if I, as a new developer, had those desired API behaviors around naming, descriptions, and responses &lt;em&gt;embedded in my tooling&lt;/em&gt;? How much easier would it be to design “the right way” if I just had to customize a relevant example rather than invent YAML whole cloth? How much more likely am I to adopt a particular error object structure if it is prompted at the beginning of every new design, as opposed to having to track it down in documentation somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not there yet with organization-level templates. And, even then, more meaningful templates for their toolchains are only the beginning. As Stack Overflow shows, there are numerous types and times for prompts in a software environment. As people trying to create better outcomes, we need to add environmental design to our available approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To Change Behavior, Change The Environment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A school’s corridor can be a problem. Children run from their rooms on one end to the exit on the other. In the stampede, someone could trip. Kids could get hurt. In even the best-case scenario, the hallway chaos riles kids up, cutting into productive classroom time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach would be to insert an authority figure. Policing the hallway, they could shush and wag their finger. Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1384439194727104513&quot;&gt;a school could install a floor like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/hallway.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a hallway with a floor tiled in such a way that it looks like it is melting out from underneath.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor is still perfectly level. However, the illusion produced by the tile design demonstrates the power of architecture. People don’t run across this. We have a change to the environment that creates a change to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyhabits.com/book/&quot;&gt;Tiny Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, BJ Fogg, PhD  describes how a behavior occurs when the following three things converge in the exact moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt; - The desire to do a behavior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability&lt;/strong&gt; - The ability to do the behavior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt; - The prompt to do the behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the bell rings at the end of class, it is a &lt;strong&gt;prompt&lt;/strong&gt; for the students to exhibit a behavior: moving from one place to another. They could walk. However, they have a low &lt;strong&gt;motivation&lt;/strong&gt; to do so; if they run they can get the best pick of seats, have more time to talk, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inserting a hallway monitor is an attempt to change the motivation and, thus, the behavior. By putting an authority figure in the space, students’ willingness to “get in trouble by running” must be taken into account. It works, but the introduction of policing and enforcement creates an antagonistic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the software governance literature starts with an apology. Then the author jumps to their particular riff of “sticks and carrots”. As you might guess, sticks represent punishment for not performing certain behaviors. Carrots are rewards for playing along. Most people can intuitively grok extrinsic “sticks and carrots”. However, despite being one of the easiest to understand methods of changing behavior, &lt;em&gt;both address only one part of the behavior equation,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;motivation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the floor illustrates, there are other ways to change behaviors. In software, our environments are composed of numerous tools. Conscientious systems thinkers &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; consider how tooling &lt;em&gt;prompts&lt;/em&gt; and empowers (or disempowers) &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt;. Without purposeful design, the behaviors created by these everyday touchpoints are left up to chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify an environment to make the right thing easy to do, and the need for someone to police behavior goes down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Versus Why Questions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/06/questions.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a card with the caption 'Absurd Questions' above a stylized question mark.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my API governance experience, I interviewed &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of teams. The purpose of those chats was always to reach a better understanding of the problem. A better understanding leads to better design. &lt;strong&gt;Most&lt;/strong&gt; of the time, these conversations were amicable, easy-going affairs. One contributing factor that kept these affairs from becoming confrontations was when I switched from asking “Why” to asking “How” questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you ask someone “Why” they do or don’t do something, you’ll inevitably provoke a defensive response. For example, when trying to learn more about somebody’s API practice, I could ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why don’t you have 100% contract test coverage?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why aren’t your API descriptions captured in a single, discoverable place?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why did you produce so many microservices?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why is your domain terminology inconsistent?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And the classic catch-all, &lt;em&gt;“Why did you do it this way?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of those may be a legitimate question. However, the nature of the question comes across as a request for justification. Worse, answers to a why question immediately entrenches the person in a list, of their own making, of confirmation bias. What was supposed to be a positive discourse has turned exhausting, as each side attempts to prove that their approach is superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking “how” is much more productive. Reframing our points from earlier changes the questions to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“How do you detect breaking changes in production?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“How do developers discover and learn how to use APIs in your area?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“How do you manage the greater complexity with your number of microservices?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“How do you describe this concept within your domain?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How did you work through the difficult decisions in this design?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the ‘how’ and ‘why’ examples address, roughly, the same areas of concern. However, the ‘how’ questions are more likely to result in people talking in greater length, detail, and thoughtfulness. They assist us in going further in exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking quality, open-ended questions creates a better rapport and a clearer idea of how to help. And the faster we get to help, the sooner our customers will find success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you feel the urge to ask “why”, try reaching for “how” instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/03/postman-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Postman Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to share that, this April, I’ll be joining Postman as the &lt;strong&gt;Director for API Platforms and Digital Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;.  I’ll be reporting to Kin Lane, Chief API Evangelist. I’m the latest addition to Postman’s Open Technologies group, an incredible, assembled group of industry-leading professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postman.com/&quot;&gt;Postman, as many developers already know, sets the bar for API collaboration excellence&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll get to help companies build their API lifecycle management and governance programs on that incredible bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m excited to get started and look forward to meeting all my future fellow &lt;em&gt;Postmanauts&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m eager to look forward, I would be remiss to not say a few words about the past. Thank you to those at Capital One for an incredibly educational five and a half years. I’m proud of so much of that early, ecosystem-enabling work. That effort has scaled to thousands of schema-defined, affordance-consistent microservices that perform &lt;em&gt;half a billion requests a day&lt;/em&gt;. From training to the collaborations, from tool development to analysis, every day was an opportunity to grow as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half-decade is also long enough to see initial assumptions grow, change, and take on a life of their own. Relationships form and strongly held ideals evolve beyond the first contact with production. I have a different level of professional maturity now that I didn’t have at the start, even if the past year has mostly been unkempt hair and sweatshirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remain a vast number of folks there continuing to create positive change. I see you, salute you, and want you to know I will continue to root for you. I also wish my former team the best of luck; you have taught me a tremendous amount. Now the wheel is yours. You’re driving where things go next. You’ve got this. I believe in you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a busy next few months. In 2015, my family moved to the East Coast for the Capital One job. The pandemic and limited travel options impressed just how removed the northern Virginia region is from our extended families. So we’ll be taking advantage of Postman’s 100% remote allowance and moving our circus to the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of &lt;strong&gt;uff-da&lt;/strong&gt; for now, but we’ll break &lt;strong&gt;lefse&lt;/strong&gt; soon enough. &lt;strong&gt;Skol&lt;/strong&gt; and boldness to you, friends!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WandaVision and This American Moment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/02/wandavision.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;WandaVision, now streaming on Disney+&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to talk about WandaVision, the Disney+ series, and the first entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Four&quot;&gt;Phase Four&lt;/a&gt;. After more than a year and a half, the team behind the series could have easily coasted on pent-up fan demand and character nostalgia. Yet, through some meticulous design decisions and serendipitous timing, WandaVision is uniquely commenting on this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social and class unrest, political skullduggery, disrupted workplaces, chaotic education situations, and economic uncertainty are all playing out amid a global pandemic. We’re at home; a move that began as a preventative measure but, increasingly, feels like a prison. Since there’s little else to do or little else we have the cognitive and emotional energy for, I’ve been watching more television than usual. Like many, I’ve binged past comfort shows while doomscrolling through insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time moves strangely in the pandemic’s unreality. One day drags along in repetitive tedium like any other. Yet the months rapidly disappear with little memory to account that they were there. Without personal touchstones - the trips, reviews, concerts, and even new media releases- I’ve become a character stuck in my own show’s reruns, repeating the routine but unable to progress the character arc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;light spoilers to follow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In WandaVision, the residents of Westview, NJ, also find themselves trapped in an unnatural reality. They are compelled, sometimes at great pain, to maintain a facade of the American dream: the suburb, the marriage, the homeownership, the stupefying white-collar job, etc. Even the town name, ‘Westview’ is a nod to western, or American, perception of success. The aspirational normalcy is an attempt to cope. And, at the end of the episode, the characters avoid the strangeness unpinning it all by watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I watch WandaVision, I see a reflection of ourselves; protagonists struggling with grief. We are unsure of how this started or when it will end. We’re in control but, not? We are grieving for those we lost. We grieve for the time we won’t get back and the plans deferred. We grieve for the myths we told ourselves about a just nation and a logical, ordered world. Wanda’s story is one of grief. Despite the superpowers, her story is eminently relatable to our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;is a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Some of us have yet to acknowledge what has happened. Some of us continue to cling, even violently, to the narratives we once had. Processing the world as it is and what has changed will continue for us for some time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would WandaVision resonate so strongly if we weren’t in a pandemic? Perhaps. I could write another post on how the show uses TV tropes and audience expectations to accentuate the storytelling. That “meta-ness” would be entertaining in any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, WandaVision becomes transcendent at this moment in which we’re all trapped in our own Westview.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why AI Success is API Built</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I gave two public presentations. I posted ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2020/07/09/APIsAreArrangementsOfPower/&quot;&gt;APIs are Arrangements of Power&lt;/a&gt;’ previously. The clean-up on the second, delievered when in-person gatherings still happened, languished due to (&lt;em&gt;gestures wildly at the surrounding air&lt;/em&gt;) things. During the holidays, however, I made an effort to finalize and pull everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recording of an abridged version of the talk is embedded at the bottom. A portion of the talk even made it into the book, &lt;em&gt;Accelerating Software Quality&lt;/em&gt;, by Eran Kinsbruner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here is ‘Why AI Success is API Built’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/strong&gt; My name is Matthew Reinbold, and tonight, I will be talking about &lt;em&gt;Why AI Success is Built on APIs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re briefly going to go over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why AI is such a big deal &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; just to level set&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about the challenges of creating AI models&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why some of those challenges lead to APIs to deliver AI functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Why is Matthew giving this talk?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m passionate about these issues because they impact my work. I am the Director of the Capital One API and Event Streaming Center of Excellence. It is a unique position that requires me to be part enterprise architect, part business analyst, and part internal developer evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I work with our 9000+ developer community to ensure that the message-passing systems built exhibit consistency and cohesion. We provide training, collaborate on API descriptions, evolve oversight processes, and facilitate co-creation on our design standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also do a fair amount in the broader API community. I write a newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;http://netapinotes.com/&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;. I curate &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapi.events/&quot;&gt;Net API Events&lt;/a&gt;, a list of in-person events for API professionals worldwide. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox&quot;&gt;tweet a fair amount, mostly about APIs but sometimes, occasionally, Lego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also make some legally dubious laptop sticker parodies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/matthewreinbold&quot;&gt;for my Patreons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Getting on the Same AI Page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that I first establish what I’m talking about when I talk about when I say ‘AI’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Clarifying AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has generated almost as much excitement as clickbait headlines. You would be forgiven to think that we’re all one errant compile away from Skynet. I mean, even the Pope is talking with Microsoft. When something crosses over into popular awareness, it is significant; even if that awareness is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, we should be on the same page. AI is a broad brush that paints many things. Usually, when you see these alarmist articles about Skynet and Terminator death robots, the authors are postulating about “&lt;strong&gt;Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;”. This is software that can “think” in a manner we associate with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still quite far from that future. What I will be talking about tonight is much more narrowly focused. So narrow, in fact, that practitioners refer to it as “&lt;strong&gt;narrow AI&lt;/strong&gt;”. Even more specifically, I will discuss a popular technique, often conflated as AI, called “&lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has real, tangible benefits for companies. It also solves interesting challenges. As an additional plus, it &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; won’t end human life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Growing at a Tremendous Rate&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were trying to follow every single new paper released in the machine learning space, you’d now be trying to absorb 100 machine learning papers &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt;. While the concepts behind machine learning have been around for some time, the current Cambrian explosion of published work has many factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moore’s Law&lt;/strong&gt; - The &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; of compute is faster than it has ever been, particularly in GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Compute&lt;/strong&gt; - Everyone can get access to these fast processors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Data&lt;/strong&gt; - For better or for worse, we are better about to scale both data collection, storage, and analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater Ease in Model Creation&lt;/strong&gt; - More people are trying more stuff more of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Chart from the blog post ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://data-mining.philippe-fournier-viger.com/too-many-machine-learning-papers/&quot;&gt;Too Many Machine Learning Papers&lt;/a&gt;’)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;What is Machine Learning?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full explanation of how machine learning, and how its various permutations work is beyond this presentation’s scope. However, as we begin to discuss why these things take so much compute or why they’re so energy expensive, we need some theoretical model in how they’re composed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for example, we had to create a service that could determine whether a provided picture was of a chihuahua or not. The output is either “yes” if a chihuahua is present or “no” if not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, we would create several &lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt; for our &lt;em&gt;input layer&lt;/em&gt;. Each of these nodes corresponds with an individual pixel of the image provided. A &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; is assigned to each of the nodes. The value of this weight is based on how important that node, or individual pixel, is to determining whether a chihuahua is present. Pixels framing the outside might have a low weighted value, while those around the inverted triangle comprising the two eyes and snout would be worth more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, I think it is important to note we’re already dealing with some large numbers with only our input layer. My first digital camera was a Sony Mavica in 1999. The &lt;em&gt;max&lt;/em&gt; resolution of a picture saved to the floppy drive was 640x480. If we were processing images in that resolution, we’d have &lt;strong&gt;an input layer of 307,200 nodes&lt;/strong&gt;. Those are 307,200 weights that need to be tuned to develop a model. And as you might imagine, pictures taken with modern mobile devices have millions of pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we’re only getting started. We take the RGB values in a given node, compute a result with the weight for that node, and then pass that value &lt;em&gt;to every other node in the subsequent layer to be processed&lt;/em&gt;. There may be many of these “hidden layers” between the input and the output. Each node in each layer mathematically computes its result. This continues until all the results are recombined into a value in the &lt;em&gt;output layer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This output layer contains the probability of whether the input meets our criteria. If it is above a particular percentage, we might say, “yes” the image did contain a dog. We continue to iterate on our weights until we are satisfied with how often our machine learning model successfully matches our labeled sample data used for training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve used machine learning to create a model to detect if our picture features a chihuahua…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For more explanation, see the YouTube video course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV3ZY6tJiA0&quot;&gt;Crash Course: AI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/WQ8CHKHHzK8&quot;&gt;Photo by Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Finding Patterns in Data is Not the Same as Understanding Data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…or a muffin. It is essential to point out that through all those mathematical calculations, machine learning doesn’t understand what it is looking at; at least not the way we do. It has only identified &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt; where two darker dots consistently appear above one other dot (eyes above the snout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/You-Look-Like-Thing-Love/dp/0316525243&quot;&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Janelle Shane described a similar problem. Microsoft has an image recognition product that works similar to our example: it takes an image and suggests what might be in it. One day, while using this product, Janelle noticed that it was finding sheep in photos that definitely did not have sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After experimentation, Janelle hypothesized that the machine learning model was trained with lots and lots of pictures of sheep in green, grassy countrysides. The model did not “learn” the sheep’s visual properties, but mistakenly correlated the landscape with the sheep label. Subsequently, when Janelle gave the model pictures of sheep in cars or livings rooms, the model labeled the animals as dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image from the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/chihuahua-or-muffin-my-search-for-the-best-computer-vision-api-cbda4d6b425d/&quot;&gt;Chihuahua or Muffin?&lt;/a&gt;’ tutorial.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Strategically Important to Companies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, machine learning is still &lt;strong&gt;a very big deal™&lt;/strong&gt; for companies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-governance-support-innovation&quot;&gt;According to an Accenture global research survey&lt;/a&gt;, 85% of business leaders expect AI to open up new products, services, business models, and markets. Another 78% expect AI to disrupt their industry in the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a report from market research firm Tractica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top500.org/news/market-for-artificial-intelligence-projected-to-hit-36-billion-by-2025/&quot;&gt;forecasts that the annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will grow from $643.7 million, in 2016, to $36.8 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a 57-fold increase and makes AI the fastest-growing segment in the IT sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, AI &lt;em&gt;is not coming to take our jobs&lt;/em&gt;. As the quote from Mary Gray says, automation doesn’t eliminate jobs; it changes the form those jobs take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Good at Specific Things&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning promises to lower costs and produce better outcomes. It’s because AI can recognize subtle patterns in vast volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton professor Arvind Narayan created an excellent presentation late last year, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf&quot;&gt;How to Recognize AI Snake Oil&lt;/a&gt;”. He identifies where machine learning techniques are practical, where they have problems, and where they may be ethically dubious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing or scaling perception is a great application of machine learning. These have clear success criteria; either the model successfully does a thing or needs additional training. Automating judgment, or asking a machine to call balls and strikes when there is some gray area, is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s predicting the future. You may use a machine learning algorithm to review someone’s social media feed and identify how often a beer bottle is pictured. That is perception. Assuming that a high percentage of beer bottle appearances makes an individual unfit for employment is predicting an outcome. That is problematic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/30/ai-is-bad-at-predicting-gpa-grit-eviction-job-training-layoffs-and-material-hardship/&quot;&gt;as research has shown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Machine learning, despite its promise, cannot tell the future.&lt;/strong&gt; It can only find correlations in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;However, Machine Learning is Not a Silver Bullet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to use common sense when considering machine learning. Martin Zinkevich is a research scientist at Google and author of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf&quot;&gt;Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering&lt;/a&gt;”. He urges several useful heuristics when evaluating whether machine learning is appropriate for a task, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If your system has more than 100 nested if-else [statements], it’s time to switch to machine learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine you’re a smartphone developer, and you’re tasked with recommending the next application someone should use. You could consider the time of day, the weather, user movement, sentiment of their social media accounts, their text and call volume, the proximity of that communication in a social graph, etc. Those could all be inputs to a complex model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could recommend the most frequently used apps. If a simple heuristic, like “recommend the most recently used items”, is successful 70% of the time, any model built has to significantly outperform it to justify the increased complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Challenges Title Screen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What form does that complexity take? Let’s talk about the challenges to developing machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are Challenges&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four big challenges to creating successful machine learning models. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The volume of data to collect and refine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The compute cost to process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regulatory, privacy and/or ethical concerns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operationalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let’s talk about Google’s Meena chatbot. A sample conversation between Meena and a human is shown in the slide. Google used &lt;strong&gt;341GB&lt;/strong&gt; of text to train the model. In doing so, &lt;strong&gt;they consumed $1.4 million in cloud computation&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s a lot of money. It is also a lot of power. For comparison, it would take the average American household  &lt;em&gt;28 years&lt;/em&gt; to burn the same 292,912 kWh of power. I might argue that the conversation is not noticeably better than Eliza, a program crafted at MIT in the 1960s. As such, there is an ethical question of whether the results warrants that level of energy expenditure (and subsequent carbon footprint).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s before we even get to operationalization and the challenges of doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html&quot;&gt;Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(More on Meena from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-meena-advances-the-exquisite-banality-of-chat-bots/&quot;&gt;ZDNet article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Building Your Own AI Models Can Be Expensive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please consider where the compute for your models is being run. If the training can be done anywhere, research which AWS regions carbon offset, for example. For reference, that is &lt;strong&gt;not US-EAST-1&lt;/strong&gt;. If the training is geographically agnostic, take a few minutes and click the necessary boxes to a configuration more carbon friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Articles pictured in this slide include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.co m/s/613630/training-a-single-aimodel-can-emit-as-much-carbonas-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/&quot;&gt;Training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614700/the-computing-power-needed-to-train-ai-is-now-rising-seven-times-faster-than-ever-before/&quot;&gt;Computer power needed is rising seven times faster than ever before&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Building on Other's Work Is Important&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, consider building upon others work. It may be hard to remember, but there was a time when the idea of having a picture of every single inch along every single street in every single place was a problem of seemingly infinite scale. Imagine if every application with a street view had to stand-up and operate their own fleet of vehicles and cameras. Yet today, anyone can call a Google Maps API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we aren’t that far removed when small and mid-sized businesses maintained their server closets. Handling things like seasonal traffic or DDS attacks was an individual challenge. Now we have APIs on cloud-providers, like AWS, to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, imagine if every application that wanted to send a text message had to negotiate individual deals with each and every telco provider? The barriers to innovation would be horrible. Better to let someone like Twilio do that once, and then we build upon the abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that these companies have exposed services via APIs, the future very much looks like leaving the big, precarious, and expensive data collection and model building to the experts. Then we consume that model through an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Enter APIs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs are an &lt;em&gt;enabling technology&lt;/em&gt;. AI doesn’t reduce or eliminate the need for APIs. &lt;strong&gt;More AI use demands more sensible and well-designed APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;APIs Provide an Abstraction to Technical Complexity&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web API (or Net API) provides a &lt;em&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/em&gt;. You have your code. You focus on uniquely solving your business problem. Then, through an API, you consume someone else’s generated model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI provider handles the tricky issues of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collecting and Refining the Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paying the electricity bill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fielding regulatory inquiries around privacy and security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing the operationalization of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Language is the Most Used AI Accessed Through APIs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the industry already moving in this direction. The chart shown was created from a survey of which types of functionality were consumed via API. Things like natural language processing are highest on the list, for the reasons that Princeton’s Arvind Narayan pointed out: these are all perception related. Scaling perception is where AI has proven its usefulness and we’re moving toward a commodification of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Chart from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistic
s/1069198/worldwide-ai-machine-learning-api/&quot;&gt;Statista.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI API Claims Require Data Questioning&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing between AI offerings via an API, it will be necessary for consumers to evaluate their claims via intelligent questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis is a data scientist and writer out of Philadelphia. In her essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the&quot;&gt;Neural nets are just people all the way down&lt;/a&gt;”, Vicki highlights some important revelations on one highly-touted AI use case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“if you’re doing image recognition in 2019, it’s highly likely you’re using an image recognition systems built by images tagged by people using Mechanical Turk in 2007 that sit on top of language classification systems built by graduate students prowling newspaper clippings in the 1960s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much we should be asking about our AI providers. However, briefly, consider the incentives. Be wary if there are financial incentives to be less than transparent about how the model is generated or where the data is collected from. Also, be skeptical if an AI product also happens to use the latest blockchain-enabled, agile-Kubernetes, nano-service hype salad. Leverage others’ work, like this article comparing cloud providers; not all pieces are this comprehensive, but there are folks out there that are sharing their results for the community’s benefit. And, finally, interrogate the data. In general, we’re not good at this, in general, but, going-forward it will increasingly be more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles pictured in this slide include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/learn-the-red-flags-ofoverhyped-ai-claims&quot;&gt;Three easy ways to evaluate AI Claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/comparing-machine-learning-as-a-service-amazon-microsoft-azure-google-cloud-ai-ibm-watson/&quot;&gt;Comparing Machine Learning as a Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dataset Nutrition Labels Need Our Support&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey was done asking folks whether they had practices in place to determine whether their data was good. Unfortunately, 44% said ‘no’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, that is not going to be an acceptable answer. We need to figure out best practices to interrogate the data. This is especially true of APIs since we may not have our hands on that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the same survey, a majority of respondents reported that their ability to analyze data was self-taught. Going forward, we will need standardized, reusable approaches to create standardized, predictable results. As proposed in the linked white paper, one idea is using a nutritional label-like representation to compare and contrast datasets used in AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting a dataset nutrition label &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help. However, keep in mind that having a robust understanding of the data is only one part of the process necessary to create a working model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Charts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1805/1805.03677.pdf&quot;&gt;The Dataset Nutrition Label Whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide21.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Conclusions&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot and, again, I’m only showing the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Where to Learn More&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more, there are numerous placed to get started. In addition to the many papers, presentations, and courses that I’ve linked to throughout this talk, I would also recommend the following books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/you-look-like-a-thing-and-i-love-you-how-artificial-intelligence-works-and-why-it-s-making-the-world-a-weirder-place/9780316525244&quot;&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You&lt;/a&gt; by Janelle Shane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/rebooting-ai-building-artificial-intelligence-we-can-trust/9781524748258&quot;&gt;A Human’s Guide to Machine Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; by Kartik Hosanagar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/rebooting-ai-building-artificial-intelligence-we-can-trust/9781524748258&quot;&gt;Rebooting AI&lt;/a&gt; by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I would highly encourage those working in the space to have a firm grasp of how these algorithmic approaches can cause harm. For that, I would suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy/9780553418835&quot;&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction&lt;/a&gt; by Cathy O’Neil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/automating-inequality-how-high-tech-tools-profile-police-and-punish-the-poor/9781250215789&quot;&gt;Automating Inequality&lt;/a&gt; by Virginia Eubanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also surprises me that there aren’t more sites that allow prospective AI users do “comparison shopping” across the major providers. Algorithmia &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be an online marketplace for algorithms. Similarly, Inten.to &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to allow running sample queries across cloud algorithms. Both appear to have since pivoted. Certain AI APIs can still be found within the Programmable Web directory, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple good sources for data, if people are looking for raw ingredients to get started. If you are aware of other sites that provide a similar service, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;How to Contact Me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and attention. My name is Matthew Reinbold and you can find me online at these fine establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the presentation given to the DC API Meetup Group, recorded February 4th, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
