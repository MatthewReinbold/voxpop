        <title>Logan, Westerns, and a Civilized Internet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the movie, &lt;strong&gt;Logan&lt;/strong&gt; (2017)? There’s no shame if you saw the promos and, previously burned by X-films, relegated it the whenever pile. However, it is quite good. Hugh Jackman, a fan-favorite onscreen character despite uneven vehicles, gets a moving, if dark, sendoff. It has the kind of depth that resulted in it featured on Wisecrack’s “The Philosophy of” series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHLw7ox458c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the video points out, Logan is less a superhero movie, and much more a &lt;em&gt;western&lt;/em&gt;. As articulated by Will Wright in his book, &lt;em&gt;Six Guns &amp;amp; Society&lt;/em&gt;, the typical western follows a predictable arc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our hero, usually a man from the wild, is embraced by encroaching civilization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The hero is dragged into conflict to protect his new, civilized friends; this struggle is often the clash between new and old worlds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He saves the day, sometimes becoming part of this new group; other times discovering that the very uncouth means to save the new world have no place in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The struggle between new and old worlds is key. The video references “Enclosure”, the 500-hundred-year old English practice of taking communal lands, which were free for anyone’s use, and &lt;strong&gt;enclosing&lt;/strong&gt; them. This creates private farms. The idea is to take something perceived as wild and uncontrollable and &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; it with ownership, rules, and law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of enclosure on the typical western hero aren’t great. As Jeremy Hsu &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/lovesick-cyborg/2017/03/24/logan-westerns-and-technological-optimism&quot;&gt;says in his review of the film&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“None of the surviving heroes in those classic Westerns truly enjoy a happy ride into the sunset. But they do all seem to recognize themselves as relics of a dying era. Their individual stories reflect the larger narrative of the Wild Wild West giving way to civilization marching in lockstep with technological progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself fortunate having come of age along with the internet. My internet wasn’t Facebook, Amazon, YouTube or even Google. It was the crazy hallucinogenic potential of the early cyberpunk authors, the fevered nonsense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondo_2000&quot;&gt;Mondo2000&lt;/a&gt;, and embarrassing, unpolished attempts at self-expression on GeoCities, web forums, and 1x1 transparent spacer GIFs. It was wild. Unpredictable. Raw. I really didn’t understand the meaning of the word “madcap” until I had a student account and an unmonitored college computer lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, but surely, &lt;em&gt;enclosure&lt;/em&gt; has come. Like the encroachment of a western’s civilized society, there’s always a benefit: predictability, safety, and comfort. Towns got a sherrif, pastor, and schools. The internet got commerce. It gave us information. And law was passed that wasn’t just good, but necessary; case in point, Title III of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fredlaw.com/news__media/2017/06/14/1548/first_federal_trial_on_website_accessibility_winn-dixie_violates_ada&quot;&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act&lt;/a&gt;. Some taming of the wild was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enclosure can go too far. “&lt;strong&gt;Zero rating&lt;/strong&gt;” is the practice of network access providers not charging customers for data when they use specific internet services. Implementing a zero rating scheme upholds the letter of net neutrality; products or services aren’t blocked. However, in a world of data-capped plans - particularly on mobile - it certainly violates the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network access providers have been playing a very long game. They’ve diversified, going from being “dump pipes” to international media conglomerates. Comcast bought chunks of NBCUniveral from 2009 to 2013. Verizon bought AOL in 2015 (Huffington Post, Techcrunch, etc.), Yahoo in 2016, and its built its own Go90 exclusive. AT&amp;amp;T is attempting to buy Time Warner and pair with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13774648/fcc-att-zero-rating-directv-net-neutrality-vs-tmobile&quot;&gt;previous DirecTV purchase&lt;/a&gt;). Even with more modest players, like TMobile, bundle services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora together in an “unlimited” package. You can still &lt;em&gt;roam&lt;/em&gt; to other places… &lt;em&gt;but it will cost you&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than compete on service or speed, content that doesn’t count against a datacap is the new competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the rough-and-tumble of the early internet is gone, and today’s current category leaders (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/5/31/15720268/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-net-neutrality-open-internet&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15816974/verizon-tumblr-net-neutrality-internet-politics-david-karp&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;!) are crowned with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/02/03/trump-fcc-zero-rating-att-verizon/&quot;&gt;the new administration&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/zero-rating-plans-are-a-serious-threat-to-the-open-internet/&quot;&gt;A statement, made last year by the previous FCC chairman, points out that zero rating practices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“present a serious threat to the Open Internet: they distort competition, thwart innovation, threaten free speech, and restrict consumer choice — all harms the rules were meant to prevent. These harms tend to fall disproportionately on low-­income communities and communities of color, who tend to rely on mobile networks as their primary or exclusive means of access to the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to take on an incumbent? Now you not only have to provide a better service or site than they do; you also have to overcome the deals they have with network access providers. How many orders of magnitude does your offering need to be for someone to, knowingly, edge toward their data cap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2017/07/logan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/logan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot from the Logan movie. Kind of how I'm starting to feel about these net neutrality fights.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People may not change, but the world’s frame of reference does. I recognized that my perception of what the internet is may be very different from someone who has always ever viewed it with an Instagram filter. Perhaps I am a relic from the old world that, having helped civilize it, now no longer has a home here. But maybe I have a fight or two left before I return to the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logan is a great movie. It is about control: the struggle in seeking, maintaining, and relinquishing it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/11/what-is-net-neutrality-threat-trump-administration&quot;&gt;July 12 is a day of protest&lt;/a&gt;. Given the political climate, there’s outrage fatigue. I get that. But if we don’t have a free and fair medium for expression, collaboration, organization, and the subsequent reporting thereof, then tackling those other challenges will be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more on the caustic effect of the current direction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15715030/what-is-net-neutrality-fcc-ajit-pai-bill-rules-repealed&quot;&gt;check out this piece from the Verge&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in getting involved, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/&quot;&gt;BattleForTheNet.com&lt;/a&gt;. There’s more at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dearfcc.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like to leave a comment on the current FCC net neutrality plan, try &lt;a href=&quot;gofccyourself.com&quot;&gt;GoFCCYourself.com&lt;/a&gt; and mention you want to see strong oversite of ISPs (just don’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/fcc-radio-silent-on-stolen-identities-writing-love-letters-for-telecoms&quot;&gt;use stolen customer identities to stuff the comment box&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if this all seems rather dull and boring, here’s what John Oliver had to say about Net Neutrality a few months ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/92vuuZt7wak&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7/12/17: Turns out, I’m not the first to make the connection between the internet and the physical American frontier. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/net-neutrality-and-the-idea-of-america&quot;&gt;Tim Wu, coiner of the term “net neutrality”, covered similar territory in his 2014 New Yorker piece.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7/19/17: Wired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/keep-net-neutrality-fight-going/&quot;&gt;has a great piece on how to keep the fight for net neutrality going&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2017/07/voxpop-circa-2009.png&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/voxpop-circa-2009.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of my Wordpress site in 2009. Yes, I am a fan of Aidan Hughes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-bit-of-context&quot;&gt;A Brief Bit of Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, shortly after moving to Denver, Colorado, I relaunched my blog. I had been, happily, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;self-hosted Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; for a number of years. However, I felt I was missing out on a learning opportunity by not making a CMS for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that I had switched to writing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; for personal note taking. I was also interested in exploring a non-database approach; blog posts would be written as flat files. I had some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html&quot;&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/a&gt; framework scaffolding for application management I wanted to further noodle with and responsive web design was begging to be explored. In short, I didn’t just want a place to dump words; I wanted a sandbox to play in. Viola! A Blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot, which was the point. But, as time passed, there were a number of wrinkles that didn’t have easy fixes without effort and/or host changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URL’s maintained the “*.cfm” ColdFusion extension, something that was increasingly dated. URL rewriting was possible, but that seemed like a workaround for what should be naturally occuring behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secure, encrypted communication (“HTTPS”) was problematic on my shared host, even in the age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. Given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage/&quot;&gt;HTTPS actually is served &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I was increasingly bothered I was not only insecure, but &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than I could be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hadn’t gone far enough with the “static site” approach. Writing the articles in markdown was a start. But then processing them through a server continued to have all the security risks while netting none of the performance upside. Very little of what I was doing required run-time processing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployments felt dated. While development teams I collaborated with in my day job had shiny, new deployment pipelines, I was still setting up FTP (not even SFTP!) and overwriting files. This is minor (I don’t believe every passion project needs the complete continuous-integration-laptop-sticker-sheet). But it &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; dated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-site-rendering&quot;&gt;Static Site Rendering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of static site rendering are numerous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEED&lt;/strong&gt; - There’s no processing server side; posts have already been reduced to the essential atomic units of the web: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. There’s something poetic to me about that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; - While not so much an issue with my own coded CMS, I lived in constant fear of missing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)&quot;&gt;zero-day&lt;/a&gt; Wordpress exploit patch and finding myself, along with clients, compromised. Reducing the number of moving parts significantly &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt; the places where something might go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting&lt;/strong&gt; - Rather than having to find, research, and deploy to increasingly rare ColdFusion hosts (or port to another language), I can post my content to anywhere that supports HTTP/JS/CSS.  hosting. This becomes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; compelling given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, one option, is &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is great. Feed it html and markdown and out comes a blog. Moving over my custom pieces, already organized as one file per post, was trivial. It was just a matter of changing my custom XML, used to define titles, tags, etc. to Jekyll’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;Front Matter YAML&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is written in Ruby but, for my purposes, it really doesn’t matter; I fire up a command line, capture my word-junk, and Jekyll does the rest. &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinlane.com/2016/04/23/the-potential-of-jekyll-as-a-static-data-engine/&quot;&gt;Kin Lane has been estolling the virtues of Jekyll for awhile&lt;/a&gt;. I’m just now catching up. &lt;strong&gt;Jekyll is free to download and run locally on your machine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-new-writing-process&quot;&gt;My New Writing Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finish a piece, I push the resulting changes, rendered by Jekyll into static content, to a Github repo. This not only gives me a record of changes over time; it also populates a Github page. This means my blog is able to leverage the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dev-sec&quot;&gt;hardened infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; that Github uses to run the rest of its operation. &lt;strong&gt;Github Pages is a free service for public repos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github page sites, understandably, have Github URLs by default. Maintaining my own domain name is important to me. If I should ever move, for whatever reason, I should be able to change the host without requiring everyone to update their links. A custom host, registered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover.com&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;abstraction that allows me to do that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Github Pages don’t easily enable SSL for custom domain names. For that, I added Cloudflare to the mix. Cloudflare is a CDN, or Content Delivery Network. They own a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of hardware and geographically scatter it about. They then replicate content distributed through them to each of these nodes. When you make a request, the content is returned from the closest server, not whatever server the content originated from. The result is &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;. But, not only that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/set-up-ssl-on-github-pages-with-custom-domains-for-free-a576bdf51bc&quot;&gt;Cloudflare can be configured so content can be delivered through its network via HTTPS, and not just HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. Given my needs, &lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare usage is free&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I can render a static site from markdown with Jekyll, deploy new updates via Git, host it on Github Pages, point to it with a custom domain, and secure it with Cloudflare. The last hurdle is take requests mistakenly made to HTTP URLs and reroute them to HTTPs (and thus avoiding the dreaded ‘mixed content’ browser nastigrams. Thankfully, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL-&quot;&gt;Cloudflare saves the day here, too&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve got a smoking fast, secure, and reasonably sound site &lt;em&gt;for the cost of a domain name and some elbow grease to put the bits together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-left-to-do&quot;&gt;What’s Left to Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, in fits and starts, been porting over previous content to the new site. I have content from 2015 and newer moved. References to the REST API Notes newsletters go back to the beginning of 2016. More to do there but having a couple years worth of the most recent material is not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design is spartan, at the moment. I’ll probably let this grow organically, as the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also am missing sub-navigation dynamically driven by a tag. For example, in an article about APIs, I could drop in some script that would create in-line navigation that would link to my other pieces about APIs. If I wrote a new piece and used the specific tag, the navigation would be updated automagically. I still need to figure out how to make this work in a static-site generated workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doesnt-medium-already-do-all-this&quot;&gt;Doesn’t Medium Already Do All This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a thousand words, I’d assume the rational question would be “Why not just get a Medium blog”? &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; is great for enabling discovery. I also have load of respect for Ev Williams and his track record in making the web a great place for creators (Blogger, Odeo [which was ahead of its time], Twitter, and now Medium). But, increasingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/medium-layoff-announcment-ev-williams/&quot;&gt;Medium seems like a failing experiment and less like a finished product&lt;/a&gt;. In trying to find a business model that works, Ev &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html&quot;&gt;has acknowledged that successful web monetization pushes publishers to ‘all car crashes, all the time&lt;/a&gt;’. That &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; makes me nervous about the longevity of any content contributed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am privileged. After decades of practice, I can suss out the techno-gobbledygook and cobble together a working site. A vast majority either can’t - or won’t. We need more viable options, not experiments, for the creation, hosting, and discovery of ideas. Until one of those happens, however, I’ll continue to be here, figuring out how to make this work on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7/19/2017: Troy Hunt has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/cloudflare-ssl-and-unhealthy-security-absolutism/&quot;&gt;a fantastic piece on CloudFlare and unhealthy security absolutism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7/20/2017: Another Troy Hunt piece, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/life-is-about-to-get-harder-for-websites-without-https&quot;&gt;discussing why the web is quickly going to &lt;strong&gt;secure by default&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I had heard about non-secured sites being punished in search engine rankings, but the browser implications are as compelling reason as any.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>API FAQ and Microservices Roundup &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest REST API Notes has been published. I highlight a great, introductory guide to RESTful API basics from Diogo Lucas written FAQ format. Then I highlight a number of authors that have shared their various perspectives on microservice development. Interestingly, their work builds off of one another in a way that gives a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; perspective on building microservice APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>API Info Comes in All Forms &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The newest version of the REST API Notes is now available. In this edition, I cover two pieces on microservices: one a podcast covering the broad landscape of challenges, the other a video that dives deep into the cultural ramifications. Switching gears, there's also a slide deck on the need for a capability approach to API design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tired API Tropes and OpenAPI News &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 5/24/17 REST API Notes are out! In this latest newsletter, I run down a list of API presentation clichés with help from my Twitter friends. What are the common tropes that we come back to repeatedly? And can we find new ones? I also touch on Mulesoft joining the OpenAPI initiative. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Status Codes, Hypermedia, Microservices, and More &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I published the latest edition of the REST API Notes newsletter on 2017/05/17. Included is a great refresher on status codes by Mark Nottingham, a recorded video presentation on  hypermedia and microservices for evolvable system design with Mike Amundsen, and just what next generation gateways like look like to Howard Dierking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Searching for Systematic Solutions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2017/04/oreilly-software-architecture.png&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/oreilly-software-architecture.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Snapshot of the stage at the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York City. While not &quot;officially&quot; a software architect anymore, I was keenly interested where the industry zeitgeist was regarding microservices, devops, and event-driven architectures. There &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; some very valuable information on tap (by the end of the second day I had a few thousand words in my notes file). But there was also a couple shadows cast; apparitions that still have me cringing a week later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A session would begin by establishing a strawman: an omission or lack of proper design would lead to an undesirable consequence in production. In one case, for example, the presentation presented an erroneous decomposition of a problem. Rather than &lt;strong&gt;bounded contexts&lt;/strong&gt; around a &lt;strong&gt;business capability&lt;/strong&gt;, they jumped straight to resources, letting the data define the subsequent API design. The result was redundant data seemingly owned by resources, requiring additional data synchronization across the distributed data-sources; i.e. a &quot;distributed monolith&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presenter would then proceed to outline a &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; elaborate solution, one that required the initial design failure. The more elaborate solution would have a titillating sounding name, of course. It was usually some combination of yesterday's buzzword and an action adjective . My take-away from these presentations is that anyone is just a &quot;hyper-componentization&quot;, &quot;rational-serverless&quot; or &quot;pico-ops&quot; away from a lucrative career in conference speaking and consultant fees.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical press is incentivized to unearth a steady stream of &lt;strong&gt;THE NEXT BIG THING&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt;! The dopamine drip of discovering the bigger, better, and/or faster way of doing things is what drives attention to online publications, book subscriptions, and conference attendance. Too often, though, this seems to result in an industry that casts off yesterday's solutions as quickly as they can get tomorrow's promises. Rather than proceeding with care and practice after missing the mark, the solution, all too often, seems to be to find new silver bullets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That phenomenon is unfortunate, and (probably) unavoidable. It is also, however, &lt;em&gt;not the most challenging thing&lt;/em&gt;. Many of the presenters were proud (and, in some cases, rightly so) for demonstrating &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; architectural solutions. Engineering conferences probably present developer solutions to the similar problems. I also guarantee that business folks are solving things from their perspective. While occasionally victories are possible, systemic success is not guaranteed because the problem is not being approached in a systemic, cross-disciplinary way. &lt;strong&gt;A company's business, culture, and technology are inextricably linked.&lt;/strong&gt; Addressing one in isolation, without considering the push and pull of the others, is likely to doom an effort (or, at a minimum, impede it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, microservices. Microservices are, simultaneously, a software architecture pattern, a cultural change, and a business concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;draft_check_box_list_0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most technologists understand microservices as a software architecture pattern. Defining service boundaries through principles domain-driven-design for the sake of decomposition is a powerful thing. But only having the &lt;em&gt;tech&lt;/em&gt; right doesn't mean microservices will be successful in an organization. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture, as defined in the O'Reilly book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050308.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microservice Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is &quot;a set of values, beliefs, or ideals that are shared by all the workers within an organization.&quot; If a employees do not trust each other, microservice coordination can't be minimized. If the organization values calendar release cycles tied to marketing blitzes, maximizing deliverable independence will be hard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adoption of any new behavior must be tied to a business benefit. If the combination of speed and safety inherent with successful microservice execution isn't reflected in a business metric, it becomes &quot;a tech thing&quot;. &quot;Tech things&quot; have a way of being entertained when times are good. However, when adversity happens, anything that isn't obviously tied to a business objective is in jeopardy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2017/04/microservices-whiteboard.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/microservices-whiteboard.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Whiteboard from a recent offsite deep dive into microservices, and what it would take to support them.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a mistake to look at the success that Amazon and Netflix have had and attribute it to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one of these parts. Their systematic success requires systematic solutions. Succeeding with a new architectural paradigm, like microservices, means creating cultural, business, and technological change. Separating meaningful approaches from buzzword buzzards at single-discipline conferences is one thing. Having the position and/or professional network to holistically apply it successfully is another. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>March Lego City Update ▶</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Time flies when you're having fun. Or at least that's the excuse I'll make for having six months having gone between Lego city walkthroughs. Numerous buildings have benefited from subtle tweaks. However, by far, the biggest effort has been building out the multi-tiered approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video is a quick fly-by of a wall in my home office. If nothing else, you can see what I do while on conference calls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lego Batman Movie Review ▶</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The original Lego movie defied expectations. What could have been a crass commercial money-grab, instead, was a delightful romp. One of the standout characters from that film was Will Arnett's &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt;. Now in his own feature-length film, will the shtick hold up? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought putting together a movie review was as good of excuse as any to practice some video making skills.&lt;/p&gt;
