                <title>The Productivity Trap</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem isn’t coding with GenAI. The problem is what coding with GenAI lets us get away with&lt;/strong&gt;. It allows us to delay making real choices, real trade-offs, and real systemic changes by giving the illusion of movement and acceleration. In a moment where maintenance, curation, and simplification are the actual leverage points, we’re rewarding copycat output. Not because software developers are stupid or short-cited, but because our incentives, our markets, and our social platforms have been rewired to reward volume over truth, sizzle over substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upfront-disclosure-i-use-generative-ai-tools-almost-every-day&quot;&gt;Upfront Disclosure: I use generative AI tools almost every day.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many otherwise genuine criticisms of AI are undercut when you discover the author has no experience with the tools, and is wailing on strawmen of their own design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will state clearly up front that I use generative AI (genAI) nearly every day. In fact, this piece was developed with the help of large language models. As a remote worker, having a tireless, talkative partner &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging&quot;&gt;to rubber-duck with&lt;/a&gt; is essential. It’s like a writing circle, albeit one that’s available 24/7, never gets hangry, and has perfect conversational recall. Even just having to articulate half-formed intuitions or unspoken feelings into a prompt is beneficial. Beyond that, something like ChatGPT is great for identifying weaknesses in arguments or highlighting hiccups in flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because I use it regularly, I see its limits. GenAI is beneficial for what it is: a fast feedback loop, a pattern spotter, and a corpus summarizer. What it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; is a substitute for the hard work of making trade-offs, reducing complexity, or building healthy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, in boardrooms and strategy decks across the tech industry, GenAI is rapidly being positioned as precisely that: a cure-all for reduced budgets, ballooning backlogs, and stressed teams struggling to maintain momentum. There’s a tremendous amount of hype, and seemingly little critical thinking, which is understandable if you think about it for a moment; &lt;strong&gt;if you’re drowning, you don’t critique any potential lifeboat&lt;/strong&gt;. But that doesn’t mean you’re destined for solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ai-hype-has-only-grown&quot;&gt;The AI hype has only grown.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’re hearing about genAI is just due to your leadership, but an entire ecosystem of misaligned incentives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html&quot;&gt;Fred Hebert, a Honeycomb.io SRE, recently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The usefulness and success of using LLMs are axiomatically taken for granted and the mandate for their adoption can often come from above your CEO. Your execs can be as baffled as anyone else having to figure out where to jam AI into their product. Adoption may be forced to keep board members, investors, and analysts happy, regardless of what customers may be needing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It does not matter whether LLMs can or cannot deliver on what they promise: people calling the shots assume they can, so it’s gonna happen no matter what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s … &lt;em&gt;not great&lt;/em&gt;. But add to that the “macroeconomic headwinds” howling since 2023 and suddenly tech leadership’s job is to make the line go up &lt;em&gt;with fewer reporting lines&lt;/em&gt;. Releases are slipping, infrastructure is groaning, and the most experienced engineers are leaving for places that didn’t mandate a return-to-office (RTO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to ignore cheerleading coming from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-08-07/odd-lots-how-goldman-sachs-is-actually-using-ai-podcast&quot;&gt;the likes of Goldman Sachs’ CIO, who recently named &lt;strong&gt;developer productivity the #1 GenAI use case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-google-engineers-coding-productive-sundar-pichai-alphabet-2025-6&quot;&gt;Google says its engineers are 10% more productive&lt;/a&gt;. And when LinkedIn is abuzz with claims like, “GenAI made development 2x faster and restored my hairline”, your leadership’s first thought isn’t, “At what cost?” but “Where do I sign?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why not? The pitch is irresistible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No reorgs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No vendor lock-in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No cultural transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just waive some corporate card expenditures for Copilot and watch the codebase commits fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the trap: developer productivity sounds like a smart and measurable goal. However, most software teams aren’t drowning because they can’t &lt;em&gt;write code fast enough&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;They’re drowning because they don’t know which code to write, they’re afraid to touch what already exists, or they’re unclear about how what they’re doing creates business value&lt;/strong&gt;. The systems they’re tasked with modifying resemble a Rube Goldberg machine; one where half the mechanisms are on fire, the other half are forgotten legacy components, and the third half was recently added in an acquisition and needs to be integrated yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversations they’re having sound like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8OnoxKotPQ?si=ufeeg7U2FooMWbYK&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the problem isn’t throughput. It’s &lt;em&gt;clarity&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;And when you chase productivity without clarity, you just accelerate the mess&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ship more” sounds great in a slide deck. Until you realize you’re shipping complexity faster than your team can understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shipping-more-faster-is-a-recipe-for-disaster&quot;&gt;Shipping more, faster is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ufried.com/blog/ai_and_software_development_1/&quot;&gt;In his series about simplifying architecture, Uwe Friedrichsen summarizes the situation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are pushing to do the wrong things better and better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GenAI is brought in to “fix” developer productivity without anyone slowing down to ask what’s actually broken, things only get worse. Because GenAI is &lt;em&gt;the ultimate enabler of “just one more”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More code, more endpoints, more opacity stacked on legacy systems, generated in milliseconds by tools that have no idea about what is right or wrong for a given context, only probabilistic matches for code in its training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may work for the seven-thousandth example of a social network client. But the more unique the context, the less capable the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genai-isnt-replacing-developers-its-replacing-decision-making&quot;&gt;GenAI isn’t replacing developers; it’s replacing decision-making.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a whole separate article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ku03ov/ibm_laid_off_8000_employees_to_replace_them_with/&quot;&gt;how companies use GenAI hype to justify layoffs and then quietly rehire for the same roles at a cheaper, overseas rate&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming your company isn’t attempting a stealth outsourcing, GenAI isn’t actually making developers obsolete. It is making &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt; obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you drop Copilot or CodeWhisperer into a team that’s already under pressure, you don’t get thoughtful design. You get &lt;strong&gt;code at the speed of vibes&lt;/strong&gt;. Half-understood prompts, half-documented results, and auto-complete-driven architecture. Everyone nods along because nobody wants to look like the one standing in the way of “the future”; or at least, there’s little professional benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Fly.io. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/&quot;&gt;Fly.io recently published a piece about how they’ve incorporated genAI into their development process&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, they claim, “AI lets us build faster, even though it makes the code worse, so we’re just trying to slow down enough to make it usable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Icelandic web developer and consultant Baldur Bjarnason points out this isn’t productivity; it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://toot.cafe/@baldur/114619175120392006&quot;&gt;“lowering the quality bar so we can high-five each other for clearing it”&lt;/a&gt;. Or said another way, &lt;strong&gt;it’s not that the code is good. It’s that it is fast, and nobody has time to care anymore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a quality problem; it’s a &lt;strong&gt;strategic one&lt;/strong&gt;. Because when GenAI becomes your default way to move forward, you stop choosing what’s worth building. You just … keep building. Faster. More often. Which only compounds problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers stop questioning the architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product teams assume delivery is “unblocked”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leadership sees velocity graphs going up and assumes it’s working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you’ve automated yourself into a corner, a bigger, messier, tech-debtier corner, but a corner nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/help.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;A pair of tweets from a user on Twitter. In the first, he brags about how he vibe coded his way to an application. In the second, he pleads for help, as things are failing and he doesn&apos;t know why.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-systems-complexity-requires-a-different-kind-of-leadership&quot;&gt;Solving systems complexity requires a different kind of leadership.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunking on the AI hype is easy; there’s several extremely online types that have made it their entire personality the last several months. It’s harder to conceive of something better, especially when your calendar is full, your team is thin, and your CFO wants you to explain why your delivery metrics didn’t improve &lt;em&gt;after you gave everyone robot interns&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say &lt;strong&gt;you’re not crazy for wanting relief&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re just not going to find it in autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What your org needs isn’t “more”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needs &lt;em&gt;maintenance&lt;/em&gt;.
It needs &lt;em&gt;curation&lt;/em&gt;. 
It needs &lt;em&gt;simplification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t sexy initiatives. They don’t demo well. You can’t put “we deleted fifteen endpoints” in a roadmap review and expect applause. But if you want your team to keep moving in five months, let alone five &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, this is the work that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a new platform or a tiger team. You need a shift in instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-behaviors-of-leaders-who-choose-resilience-over-vibes&quot;&gt;Five Behaviors of Leaders Who Choose Resilience Over Vibes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Default to Deletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you greenlight another service, ask what can be shut down. Before you automate a workflow, ask whether it’s still necessary. Before you ship more, try &lt;em&gt;shipping less&lt;/em&gt;. On purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t need to do more faster - we need to do less, better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Reward Understandability&lt;/strong&gt;
If you can’t explain it to a new hire in ten minutes, it’s a liability. Stop rewarding clever hacks. Start celebrating clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elegance is not optimization. It’s comprehension&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Defer Decisions That Add Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;
Postpone what you can. Push back on “just in case” extensibility. Favor defaults. Shrink option surfaces. Don’t widen interfaces unless there is an explicit use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every new option is a tax on future understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Curate What You Have&lt;/strong&gt;
Prune your internal APIs. Archive stale docs. Audit your SDKs. Stop showcasing &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; you have. Start showcasing what actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t curate your ecosystem, you’re just letting complexity run the museum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Ask: “What If We Did Nothing?”&lt;/strong&gt;
This one is counterintuitive but powerful. Not everything needs a fix.
Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone can stomp on the gas. Leadership is knowing when to pump the brakes - and when to get out and walk around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what stewardship looks like. It’s not loud. It’s not flashy. And it won’t get you featured on HackerNews. However, it may just give your team a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintenance-is-the-new-moonshot&quot;&gt;Maintenance is the new moonshot.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the sustainable, pragmatic way forward, why are so few actually talking about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I go back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html&quot;&gt;Hebert’s piece&lt;/a&gt;, as he describes the situation quite concisely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Things won’t change, because people are adaptable and want the system to succeed. We consequently take on the responsibility for making things work, through ongoing effort and by transforming ourselves in the process. Through that work, we make the technology appear closer to what it promises than what it actually delivers, which in turn reinforces the pressure to adopt it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the responsibility for realizing AI’s hyperbole is delegated to its human implementers. And if the Mechanical Turk fails to deliver, it is considered the operator’s fault, not the technology’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there are no TED speaker slots for “Doing Fewer Things Slightly Better.” No book deals for “Slow Architecture”. VCs aren’t throwing term sheets at companies promising to do &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t make it any less critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with acceleration, &lt;strong&gt;choosing to maintain - to understand, to simplify, to prune - is now a radical act&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s leadership that resists panic. It’s a strategy that values longevity over the next quarter’s dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GenAI isn’t the enemy. But misusing it to paper over hard choices - to avoid trade-offs, to compile more complexity, to pantomime progress - that’s how we break things beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The systems we build reflect the choices we make under pressure. Choose maintenance. Choose clarity. Choose to lead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Grow Your Community</title>
                <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;image-credit-reinbold-ollie-untitled-sketch-2025-pencils&quot;&gt;Image Credit: Reinbold, Ollie. &lt;em&gt;Untitled sketch&lt;/em&gt;. 2025, pencils.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “community” comes up a lot in my software consulting work. There are open-source communities. Developer communities. Platform communities. Increasingly, companies expect their employees to form Communities of Practice to solve their cross-silo dysfunction. You’ll find “community” on strategy decks, in job titles, and embedded in marketing copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I work with software leaders on what that actually means and what real community looks like to them, I too often get platitudes or marketing slides.”Community” is what they say when “customer” feels too thirsty or “free labor” too honest. It’s a favorite industry euphemism, human enough to sound desirable, broad enough to mean nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between what is desired and what is implemented leads to company efforts that are often DOA. These communities flop not because the idea is bad but because the people “running the community initiative” are drawing upon their shallow experience. 
For example, take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-deal-with-loneliness-epidemic-startups-companies.html&quot;&gt;the community example as described by writer Allison P. Davis in The Cut&lt;/a&gt;. There, Davis explored what happens when software startups try to fix the “loneliness epidemic” with community approximations. The described results certainly triggered my unease: apps that offer paid friendships, gamified connections, and bookable plus-ones. It was like ordering Doordash but for communion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is real. In his 2000 book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowling Alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author Robert D. Putnum describes the decline in non-workplace interactions. He argued that the reduction in everything from Knights of Columbus membership to church participation would have dire consequences for democratic discourse. Putnum references something as innocuous as the humble bowling league is a community capable of providing belonging, education, and enrichment for its members’ social lives. And yet, while the number of people who bowled increased in the past 20 years, the number of bowlers who bowled in leagues - much like any other group where social interactions may occur - has decreased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putnum’s observations happened more than a generation ago. The trend has only continued since then. And it is this lack of community experience, or what it means to be a part of a functioning one, is troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-rural-areas-community-can-be-the-difference-between-survival-and-ruin&quot;&gt;In rural areas, community can be the difference between survival and ruin.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up on a farm in rural South Dakota. There isn’t a slogan or brand engagement strategy for that community. It is an unspoken set of expectations and obligations that made the sometimes unpredictable and harsh turns of fate survivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is never a good time to get sick - like really sick, like having to be hospitalized sick. But if a neighbor fell ill during harvest season, a year’s worth of work and tens of thousands of dollars in seed, fertilizer, and labor could be wiped out in a couple of ill-timed weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that happened (and it did happen), the response wasn’t only thoughts and prayers. It was a convoy of neighbors. People would show up with their combines, grain carts, semis - everything needed to get the crop in safe before the weather could decide otherwise. They’d put their own fields, deadlines, and fragile margins on hold. Because letting someone lose everything wasn’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no distributed disaster playbook. No pre-arranged phone tree. No nudges or banked service hours. People there don’t gussy it up as a “mutual aid network” or a “decentralized response framework.” They call it being a good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;happened&lt;/em&gt; because it was what needed to be done. Being neighborly isn’t a service you subscribe to but a shared responsibility you can’t opt out of. You helped because you knew, someday, it might be you. And when it was, you’d need someone who remembered how you showed up for theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural communities, the firefighter isn’t a stranger in uniform. It’s your neighbor. The coach isn’t an employee. It’s your uncle. The ambulance driver isn’t a city worker - it’s a volunteer who also works at the electric co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural communities, the line between neighbors and supporting services is blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-is-not-just-a-rural-thing&quot;&gt;Community is not just a rural thing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But community isn’t just a rural thing. The pattern of showing up is everywhere if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/11/24/at-rogers-park-tent-city-housed-and-unhoused-gather-for-new-tradition-weekly-chili-night/&quot;&gt;the story of Rogers Park, outside of Chicago, of a group of housed and unhoused neighbors who created Chili Night&lt;/a&gt;. Every Thursday, weather granting, people gather near a tent encampment in Touhy Park to share food, warmth, and company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no non-profit running it. No app. No GoFundMe. Just folding tables, Crock-Pots, and a shared understanding: &lt;em&gt;sharing a meal isn’t a burden but a blessing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not about feeding the unhoused. It’s about being in community with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People show up for each other, week after week because presence itself is the point. Because being human in public, without hierarchy or prerequisites, is surprisingly rare and incredibly sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No check-ins. No metrics. No scalable impact report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a ritual of care and the slow accumulation of trust to create a decentralized, voluntary, self-sustaining practice. You don’t need grain carts and combines to build that kind of system. You need regularity, a shared table, and the recognition that surviving alone is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to the workplace and all the ways companies get this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-cant-scale-what-you-havent-practiced&quot;&gt;You can’t scale what you haven’t practiced.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Rogers Park offers an example of a functioning community that is low-cost, high-trust, and built on repeated presence, tech offers another: slick, structured, and one-directional. Many working in software wouldn’t know better because they haven’t experienced a real one. Or, if they have, they didn’t recognize it for what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software organizations, “community” is a term deployed with great enthusiasm and very little introspection. It’s used when we want engagement but don’t want to pay for support. It’s trotted out when we want to tout the total number of users but don’t want to do user research. It’s slapped on events, platforms, and newsletters because “customer” feels too transactional and “audience” too passive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tech leaders try to “build community” without understanding what community actually requires, the results are somewhere between awkward and quietly corrosive. They:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake audience for community&lt;/strong&gt;. An audience listens. A community responds. If your strategy is built around likes, views, and passive consumption, you don’t have a community. You have reach. And reach is not the same as belonging.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equate participation with presence&lt;/strong&gt;. Just because people show up doesn’t mean they feel safe, seen, or supported. Attendance is not connection. Zoom squares and emoji reactions are not proxies for trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect engagement without reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;. You can’t ask people to contribute to something that gives them nothing back, whether that is in time, recognition, or psychological safety. A Slack channel full of ghosted questions isn’t a community. It’s a liability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glorify lone heroes while ignoring maintainers&lt;/strong&gt;. Tech loves a weekend war room. We reward the heroic save. But we ignore the ones who make sure it never broke in the first place. We’ve built cultures that celebrate firefighting and scoffs at fireproofing. No wonder people burn out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate culture to tools&lt;/strong&gt;. You can’t Workday your way into mutual trust. You can’t PowerPoint your way into shared values. Tools can help, but they don’t replace the emotional labor of actually showing up for each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that community can’t happen inside organizations. It’s that the conditions required to nurture it - trust, time, and shared responsibility - are almost always seen as overhead. And so the things that actually hold people together are dismissed as optional, inefficient, or “not part of the job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’ve ever been part of a team that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; worked, you know the truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Community doesn’t happen just because people are put in proximity to each other. It only happens because members went out of their way to do the things not easily quantified in their performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-communities-are-grown-not-built&quot;&gt;Real communities are grown, not built.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a leader, a practitioner, or someone who’s just tired of siloed rebuffs stymieing needed progress. You want a genuine Community of Practice, not a ghost town intranet site or a newsletter with a 12% open rate. You seek a living, breathing network where people &lt;em&gt;actually help each other get better at what they do&lt;/em&gt;, and you needed it yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can build a community of practice, you must understand what a real community requires. Mandating your way to communities, via command-n-control methods, won’t work. However, prepping the environment, much like a farmer prepares the soil for what might be grown, will increase your odds of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-shared-survival-challenge&quot;&gt;A Shared Survival Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities don’t form because people like each other. They form because people need each other. What’s at stake if you don’t get better at this craft together? What problems are too big, too fast-moving, or too ambiguous for one team to solve alone?
If your community isn’t anchored to a clear, shared challenge, it becomes a hobby group - or worse, the often-tried and failed &lt;em&gt;company book club&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-and-permission-to-show-up&quot;&gt;Time and Permission to Show Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s not on the roadmap, it’s not a priority. Side of the desk work is the first to fall on the floor when things get stressed. People can’t contribute to a community when they’re drowning in delivery work. Protect the time. Normalize participation. Make it part of the job, not a fit-it-in-when-you-can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognition-of-the-right-work&quot;&gt;Recognition of the Right Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just celebrate the people who give lightning talks or lead flashy demos. Recognize the folks who answer the same question ten times a month. The ones who fix the wiki. The ones who reach out to the new hire and say, “Hey, if you’re stuck, I’ve got time.” This is the invisible labor that keeps a community alive. This is the glue work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-were-taught-to-ignore-the-glue-people&quot;&gt;We were taught to ignore the glue people.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every healthy community, whether it is a software org, a rural town, or a tent city park, depends on a specific kind of person. It isn’t the visionary nor the rockstar. It is not the ninja nor the 10x developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the person who remembers birthdays. The person who answers questions without making you feel stupid. The person who nudges the conversation back to what matters. The person who makes sure the snacks are labeled and the new folks feel seen. These are the “glue people,” and modern software has been lying about their importance for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/08/28/contempt-for-the-glue-people/&quot;&gt;former Google CEO Eric Schmidt openly derided glue people&lt;/a&gt;. To him, the developers who wrote code and the product managers attached to them created a company’s value. The facilitators, translators, and maintainers of community, as well as everyone else who might be employed at a company, were a drag on velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, technology is quick to copy, and in the rush to scale like Google, too many tech leaders absorbed Schmidt’s contempt without questioning the context. And in doing so, they hollowed out their own organizations, devaluing the very people who &lt;strong&gt;made knowledge flow&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;prevented silos&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;held relationships together across functions and teams&lt;/strong&gt;. That mindset has been quietly devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know why your Community of Practice fizzled? Ask yourself who the glue person was and whether anyone supported them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real community doesn’t scale &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; glue people. It scales &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the people who do the emotional labor of culture maintenance; those who build bridges, hold memory, and sense when things are about to snap. They are the human infrastructure that makes knowledge work… work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, they are rarely promoted. Rarely rewarded. Often burned out and quietly exited, leaving behind a strangely brittle organization that doesn’t understand why things feel so much harder now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep trying to automate connection, to platformize care, to metricize trust. But we won’t get anywhere until we recognize that the work of holding people together &lt;em&gt;is work&lt;/em&gt;. It’s essential. And it’s worth protecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-even-neighbor-bro&quot;&gt;Do you even neighbor, bro?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been carrying a low-grade anxiety since the last election. It’s not just the headlines of the “no bottom” variety. It’s the increasing realization that systems like disaster response, weather forecasting, and even basic democratic stability are far more fragile than I’d care to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to find comfort in social media activism. A petition signed here or a strongly worded email there &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; like a great use of this unlimited, world-wide publishing machine we all have access to. However those were just tiny pixels washed out in the 4K, omnichannel blitz of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with that token bare minimum feels hollow in our current situation. I still write my representatives. I still stay informed. The macro fight matters. But if this exercise in kleptocratic idiocracy has taught me anything, it’s that the micro matters, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, the vast, vast majority of us occupy places other than Washington, D.C., or Silicon Valley. These are neighborhoods, schools, parks, slack channels, and even codebases. These are our fields, ones that we can fight for or choose to leave fallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means practicing something smaller and slower. For me, that means inviting my kids’ friends and their parents over to roast hot dogs in the backyard. It means getting offline and going for walks with people I only know from profile pictures. I am trying to show up to things that aren’t optimized for efficiency - the small talk, the get-together in a park, even volunteering to help organize the local ultimate club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t world-changing acts, but they are &lt;em&gt;world-sustaining ones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re an attempt to plant seeds of community - not for show, not for scale, but for resilience. For the hope that something unpredictable, wild, and new might grow. And when the storm comes, and it will come, I’ll know how to answer the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t grow community with a business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You grow it by being willing to plant, tend, and trust what you can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You grow it by showing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You grow it by growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>This Stupidity Is Brought to You by the Letter F</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Life before electrification isn’t some dorm room hypothetical about the good old days of kerosene and character. It’s something my grandfather actually lived through. He spoke &lt;em&gt;glowingly&lt;/em&gt; about the Rural Electrification Administration. In the 1930s and 40s, the REA brought power for production, radios for news, and watts for refrigeration and heat to rural South Dakota. In other words, REA lit this corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several decades, and I was a kid growing up on that same patch of prairie. Our farm had electricity, sure, but options? Not so much. On a good weather day, we might pick up the NBC or CBS affiliates from Bismarck, ND, over a hundred miles away. But even when those cut out, we could always count on &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; PBS stations. And thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent hours parked on ropey shag carpet watching &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;3-2-1 Contact&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reading Rainbow&lt;/em&gt;, and dozens of others whose names I’ve forgotten but whose lessons stuck. Later, when helping Dad in the fields, I’d tune the tractor’s radio to NPR: &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prairie Home Companion&lt;/em&gt; - those shows were a lifeline of signal and sense in a static spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weren’t just shows. They were oxygen. They were curiosity over noise, creativity over ratings, possibility over profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally, the latest plan is to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday, President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/trump-signs-order-that-aims-cut-funding-npr-pbs-2025-05-02/&quot;&gt;signed an executive order demanding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) cut all direct funding to NPR and PBS&lt;/a&gt;. This after Trump previously failed to eliminate funding in the federal budget for the organization (Congress allocated the funds anyway) and fire the CPB’s board members (something he technically doesn’t have the power to do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because nothing says “limited government” like micromanaging &lt;em&gt;Elmo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connection-is-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Connection is Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A country doesn’t stop at the edge of the suburbs. The REA knew that in the 1930s, which is why it didn’t throw up its hands and say, “Sorry, Dakotas; come back when you have your own Rockefeller or J.P. Morgan.” It brought electricity to the places that private industry couldn’t be bothered with. Because connection isn’t just about convenience. It’s about opportunity. It’s about building neighborhoods. It’s about saying, “You live here too. You matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same mindset is what made public broadcasting work. NPR and PBS didn’t show up in rural towns because there was money to be made. They showed up because we decided - as a country - that everyone should have access to stories, education, and the arts - not just the zip codes capable of subscribing to stream six subscription services only to complain that there’s nothing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That access is infrastructure. Not fiber optics or 5G towers; &lt;em&gt;cultural infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn’t just keep the lights on. It keeps the mind open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what Silicon Valley thinks, not everyone has “infinite content.” In countless rural towns, tribal lands, and underserved neighborhoods, CPB stations are still the only ones reliably broadcasting &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; beyond conservative AM talk radio and reality television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to cut that? Congratulations: you’re not shrinking the government. You’re shrinking our cultural appreciation to what’s popular at the local truck stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;windows-not-mirrors&quot;&gt;Windows, Not Mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most media today is a mirror, and not even a good one. It’s like one of those warped funhouse jobs, one that shows you the same outrage, the same playlist, the same algorithmic dopamine hits over and over until you’re convinced &lt;em&gt;you’re America’s main character&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public broadcasting doesn’t play that game. It’s a window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, those windows opened to a world where spelling was fun, art was possible, and kindness was a virtue, not something worthy of derision. &lt;em&gt;3-2-1 Contact&lt;/em&gt; made me feel like a scientist. &lt;em&gt;Mark Kistler&lt;/em&gt; made me believe I could draw a three-dimensional cube - and maybe, someday, a life beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grew older, the windows just got bigger. &lt;em&gt;Great Performances&lt;/em&gt; aired ballet from New York. &lt;em&gt;Austin City Limits&lt;/em&gt; introduced bands I’d never hear on Top 40. &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt; offered nuance, not noise. &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Masterpiece Theatre&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Live from Lincoln Center&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; - shows that trusted you to be curious without clickbait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the fields, driving the combine, NPR didn’t just fill the the gaps between static, it filled the &lt;em&gt;gaps in my understanding&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Car Talk&lt;/em&gt;, and more - these were shows that made me laugh, made me think, and filled the void between horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weren’t just programs. They were public goods wrapped in broadcast signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defund CPB and you’re not just pulling funding. You’re pulling the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trusted-journalism-for-less-than-a-cup-of-coffee&quot;&gt;Trusted Journalism for Less Than a Cup of Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some critics call NPR and PBS “state-sponsored media,” as if &lt;em&gt;Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me&lt;/em&gt; is a weekly psy-op and &lt;em&gt;Antiques Roadshow&lt;/em&gt; is how the government launders vintage depression glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives about &lt;strong&gt;$500 million&lt;/strong&gt; a year. That sounds big—until you stack it against the &lt;strong&gt;$6.9 trillion&lt;/strong&gt; federal budget. CPB’s share? About &lt;strong&gt;0.007%&lt;/strong&gt;. If the federal budget were a dollar, CPB would be getting &lt;strong&gt;seven-tenths of a penny&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works out to about &lt;strong&gt;three bucks per American taxpayer per year&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably spent more than that this morning on a latte that tasted like toasted mulch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, you get &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BBC World Service&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt;, and yes - &lt;em&gt;Arthur&lt;/em&gt;. You get national news that isn’t chasing clicks, local radio that doesn’t have more ads than content, and investigative reporting that isn’t trying to get ratioed on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defunding it isn’t about saving money. It’s about starving truth. It’s about ensuring the only voices left are the ones yelling… increasingly through megaphones they control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cost-of-a-public-good-is-the-cost-of-a-functioning-society&quot;&gt;The Cost of a Public Good Is the Cost of a Functioning Society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one demands the fire department turn a profit. We don’t expect roads to pay for themselves via billboards and sponsored potholes. Amber Alerts don’t have “click to skip ad” buttons and the U.S. Postal Service doesn’t only serve zip codes with good margins. Public services cost money—because &lt;em&gt;they’re worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rural electrification didn’t happen because private companies felt generous. It happened because the government had the guts to wire up the places Wall Street wouldn’t touch. And what happened? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19743/w19743.pdf&quot;&gt;Productivity soared. Property values climbed. Infant mortality fell.&lt;/a&gt; According to economic historians, it was one of the best infrastructure investments in American history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public broadcasting operates on that same principle. It may not juice anyone’s quarterly earnings, but it boosts school readiness, civic participation, and basic media literacy - especially in places commercial media abandoned decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cct.edc.org/sites/cct.edc.org/files/ms-resources/TransmediaMathStudy_0.pdf&quot;&gt;A PBS-sponsored study found that children who watched PBS Kids made &lt;strong&gt;significantly greater gains in math and literacy&lt;/strong&gt; than their peers&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not “TV as a babysitter.” That’s TV as a classroom. A mentor. A portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPB doesn’t cost much. But it does cost &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. And it should. Because that’s what we do with good things—we &lt;em&gt;invest&lt;/em&gt; in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-wait-for-the-obituary&quot;&gt;Don’t Wait for the Obituary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a drill. With the stroke of a pen, Trump ordered CPB to cut all direct funding to NPR and PBS. After failing to kill it in Congress and fire the board comes the slow strangulation by legally dubious decree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: stations will go dark, especially in rural areas where the margins are thin and the signals are already faint. Some won’t come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where you come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got the means, donate to your local station. Don’t wait for a tote bag. Don’t wait for the guilt-trippy jazz saxophone interludes during pledge week. Do it because the lights &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; flickering and someone has to keep them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the cash right now, fair enough. But turn it on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/stations/&quot;&gt;Find your local PBS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/stations&quot;&gt;NPR affiliate&lt;/a&gt;. Watch it. Listen to it. Let your kid stumble onto something beautifully weird between &lt;em&gt;Sid the Science Kid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;. Let yourself be surprised by something that wasn’t written by an algorithm or filtered through a for-you-page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it for a week. You might find your new favorite show. Or at least remember what it’s like to be informed by something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than your feed.
This isn’t just about programming. It’s about a shared belief that every zip code deserves signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we let CPB go dark, we’re not just cutting costs - we’re cutting people out. And no one should need a streaming subscription to feel like a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2024-05-13&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2024-05-13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defunding the CPB isn’t new. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baltimoresun.com/2012/10/11/big-bird-is-more-real-than-romneys-budget-plans/&quot;&gt;I stumbled across this political cartoon by David Horsey &lt;em&gt;from 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Several versions have been circulating online recently, albeit with “Elon Musk” replacing “Mitt Romney”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/sesame_street.webp&quot; alt=&quot;A cartoon using the Sesame Street Characters. Moving from left to right, Ernie says, &amp;quot;Hey, kids! Just six hours of spending on defense equals the entire federal subsidy for public television!&amp;quot; Big Bird then says, &amp;quot;But Mitt Romney thinks he can balance the budget by de-funding us!&amp;quot; The Count then says, &amp;quot;Mitt needs to learn how to count!&amp;quot; Cartoon is by David Horsey comic (from the Baltimore Sun?!)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the age, the math still checks out: approximately &lt;em&gt;six hours of what the U.S. spends on defense is the equivalent of &lt;strong&gt;an entire year&lt;/strong&gt; of CPB funding&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-05-14&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2025-05-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this week, Minnesota Public Radio set a goal of raising &lt;strong&gt;$1 million&lt;/strong&gt; during their spring pledge drive. It was an audacious amount, but one that was, seemingly, necessary in face of state and federal funding uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did they reach their goal - &lt;em&gt;they smashed it&lt;/em&gt;. The million was raised by early Friday and then members continued shocking the on-air talent with the amount and speed with which gifts were matched - something that their 20-year veterans referred to as “historic”. These are are challenging times, and not every NPR or PBS station has the same community support as MPR. But seeing folks &lt;em&gt;turn up&lt;/em&gt; and respond to this call overwhelmingly was a fantastic win to carry into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preferred MPR station is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecurrent.org/&quot;&gt;The Current&lt;/a&gt;, a non-commercial indie rock station. It is broadcast across Minnesota and can be streamed online. It recently celebrated its 20th anniversary and I’m thrilled that it’ll continue being around for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Ironies of Agentic AI</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ironies-of-automation-paper-defines-a-paradox-of-automation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Ironies of Automation” Paper Defines a Paradox of Automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruth Malan, a software architecture and systems consultant, organizes the wonderful “Papers in Systems” discussion series (I’ve also taken her &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/11/01/PolarityMappingAndAPIGovernance&quot;&gt;Organizational Design Masterclass&lt;/a&gt;). During those virtual Zoom sessions, facilitators present a noteworthy paper, and the assembled group share their thoughts on the piece. It can be an eye-opening experience, if for no other reason than to realize that annoying boogeyman you thought you faced alone happens to also be hiding under a lot of other people’s beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/bredemeyer/bainbridgeironiesofautomation&quot;&gt;The latest installment&lt;/a&gt;, led by Alex Ptakhin, covered Lisanne Bainbridge’s 1983 paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.complexcognition.co.uk/2021/06/ironies-of-automation.html&quot;&gt;Ironies of Automation&lt;/a&gt;. As Bainbridge says on that site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This was written before I had a personal computer, let alone a mobile phone. Of course there has been much process in the last 40 years in the technology of providing both operators and writers with support, but evidently the question remain.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is true. While Bainbridge’s observations were on the operation of industrial control systems, she might as well have been talking about how today’s organizations approach AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainbridge’s begins with an apparent paradox: that by adding automation to a system &lt;strong&gt;increases&lt;/strong&gt; the dependency on a trained human operator rather than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The classic aim of automation is to replace human manual control, planning and problem solving by automatic devices and computers. However, as Bibby and colleagues (1975) point out : “even highly automated systems such as electric power networks, need human beings for supervision, adjustment, maintenance, expansion and improvement. Therefore one can draw the paradoxical conclusion that automated systems still are man-machine systems, for which both technical and human factors are important.” This paper suggests that the increased interest in human factors among engineers reflects the irony that the more advanced a control system is, so the more crucial may be the contribution of the human operator.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automation paradox is that automation is pursued to remove human inefficiencies, yet highly automated systems still require human supervision, adjustment, maintenance, and decision-making. This is because operators are often left with tasks that are difficult to automate, such as handling emergencies or diagnosing failures. And the more sophisticated an automated system becomes, the more crucial human involvement may be and the more cognitively demanding the job becomes, especially in abnormal situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that &lt;strong&gt;rather than removing human dependencies, &lt;em&gt;automation often shifts and amplifies them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’ve ever been part of a DevOps or Platform Engineering transformation effort that started with great fanfare and then found yourself drowning in YAML only a few years later, you have experienced this phenomenon personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todays-automation-de-jour-agentic-ai&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Automation De jour: &lt;em&gt;Agentic AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes this a great moment to talk about &lt;em&gt;Agentic AI&lt;/em&gt;. By now, most people have had some first-hand experience with generative AI. Even if you aren’t generating images with Midjourney or emails with ChatGPT, you’ve probably seen generated summaries at the top of your search results, had it pop up in your office suite, or discovered that a VC swapped it for the toy in your breakfast cereal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI, an increasingly buzzy term since being coined last November, takes this a step further. It refers to programmatic systems that can &lt;em&gt;autonomously&lt;/em&gt; take actions, pursue goals, and make decisions without human intervention at every step. Unlike people’s use of &lt;em&gt;Claude&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ChatGPT’s&lt;/em&gt; chat interfaces, which respond when prompted, agentic AI actively engages with its environment, initiating actions and persisting toward objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In describing Agentic AI as the highest level in their enterprise AI maturity model, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/evolving-from-pre-ai-to-agentic-ai-apps-a-4-step-model/&quot;&gt;Michael Coté and Camille Crowell-Lee describe Agentic AI operation as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breaking down a request into a plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Executing each step (calling APIs, running microservices, executing code).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyzing the outcomes, adjusting if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example they use to describe how this works in practice is, basically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4JNLL7U8H8&quot;&gt;the plot of those Matthew McConaughey Salesforce ads&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Think back to the restaurant reservation app. First, the agentic application would reason out that it needs to find your preferences for a restaurant. This might mean asking you directly, but it might also mean looking at your past reservations and reviews you gave. Perhaps you like sitting outside, but is it raining? The intelligent application would look up weather for your area. And so forth. Once this “research” is built up, the agentic AI will then use its tools to look up available tables at matching restaurants, and if it finds a good match, make the reservation for you, again by making an API call. Of course, a human (that’s you!) can step in at any point to move the workflow along or modify it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ramifications-of-looking-at-agentic-ai-through-an-irony-of-automation-lens&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramifications Of Looking At Agentic AI Through an “Irony of Automation” Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the “step in at any point” statement. Suppose we apply Brainbridge’s Ironies of Automation truths to Agentic AI. In that case, we can anticipate several key ramifications - many of which mirror or even amplify the problems previously seen in automation-heavy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-oversight-paradox-humans-will-still-be-needed-but-in-more-challenging-ways&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Oversight Paradox: Humans Will Still Be Needed But in More Challenging Ways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation&lt;/strong&gt;: Agentic AI systems will be fully autonomous, reducing the need for human intervention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you thought war-room debugging was bad now, just imagine all the comradery you’ll get from HAL 9000 after the pager-duty notification goes off at 2am.&lt;/em&gt; Humans will still need to monitor, correct, and override AI behavior, but this task will become more complex and cognitively demanding because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI decisions are made using logic that may be opaque or non-deterministic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Failures will often occur at the edges of AI capability, where human expertise is weakest (since humans will have been out of the loop).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings&quot;&gt;Just as pilots struggle to take over when autopilot fails&lt;/a&gt;, humans will be asked to intervene in situations they are least prepared for, often under stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramification&lt;/strong&gt;: AI oversight will become a specialized, high-cognitive-load task rather than a simple supervisory role. Human skills will atrophy while reliance on AI grows, at least until intervention is suddenly needed in a high-stakes situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-black-box-monitoring-problem&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Black Box Monitoring Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents will self-monitor and self-correct, reducing human burden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reality&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Explainable AI” is still one to two years away, just like how Level 5 self-driving cars are gonna happen any day now and this will be the year of Linux on the desktop&lt;/em&gt;. Monitoring AI will be qualitatively different from traditional automation because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI decision-making is often opaque (e.g., large language models, reinforcement learning).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI operates in complex, evolving environments, making the establishment of clear rules for acceptable behavior harder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI doesn’t just “execute” tasks like traditional automation - it autonomously decides how to execute them, creating failure modes that are hard to anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramification&lt;/strong&gt;: Humans will struggle to monitor AI decisions in real-time, just as DevOps engineers struggle with brittle, YAML-driven pipelines. The very complexity AI is meant to reduce will resurface in debugging its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-skill-rot-problem-humans-as-unpracticed-ai-owners&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Skill Rot” Problem: Humans as Unpracticed AI “Owners”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation&lt;/strong&gt;: AI will handle most routine decision-making, freeing humans for “higher-level” strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Remember the Y2K bug, when enterprise recruiters beat down retirement home doors for Fortran and Cobol programmers? What if we recreate that 52-card pickup between all our subject matter experts and our business-sensitive context on a recurring basis?&lt;/em&gt;  When humans are removed from day-to-day operations, their ability to intervene effectively in edge cases deteriorates, similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pilots losing manual flying skills due to autopilot dependence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Process operators in automated plants struggling to diagnose failures because they lack hands-on experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software developers becoming automation babysitters rather than programmatic experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramification&lt;/strong&gt;: Human expertise will degrade over time, just as in other automation-heavy fields. This is dangerous because when AI fails, humans will have to step in, but they’ll be less capable of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-brittle-autonomy-trap&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brittle Autonomy Trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation:&lt;/strong&gt; AI systems will become robust and handle more complex tasks over time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reality&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;You asked the AI to buy lunch for the seaside offsite, and now it’s sending a DoorDash driver with 48 pounds of frozen shrimp to your office.&lt;/em&gt; Over-automated AI systems could become brittle, meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI can handle predictable tasks exceptionally well, but when unexpected scenarios arise, it collapses catastrophically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI can mask failures - just as industrial automation can compensate for a failing machine until a catastrophic breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humans may not realize AI is failing until it is too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramification:&lt;/strong&gt; AI will make systems appear more stable than they are until a major failure reveals hidden fragility, just as DevOps pipelines and industrial automation have done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ironies-of-agentic-ai&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ironies of Agentic AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1979, a presentation at a regional IBM office led to one of the most memeable images of our age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/accountable.png&quot; alt=&quot;1979 IBM slide stating in ALL CAPS that &amp;quot;A computer can never be held accountable therefore a computer must never make a management decision&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dair-community.social/@emilymbender/112821332058013242&quot;&gt;While many have attempted to track the original author&lt;/a&gt;, the slide’s origins appear to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2024/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable&quot;&gt;been lost to a flood in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But the sentiment is true: people need to be accountable, not just to provide the “one neck to wring” when things go wrong, but because AI has no concept of morality, ethics, or law. Human judgement in these systems is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we delegate to AI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more challenging it will be for humans to intervene effectively when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more brittle and opaque our systems will become.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The greater the risk that AI will exacerbate rather than eliminate human errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Bainbridge’s Ironies of Automation warned that automation doesn’t eliminate human problems but shifts them, &lt;strong&gt;Agentic AI may increase a company’s dependence on human oversight, but in a harder, not easier way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives, especially under current economic pressure, are keen to buy Agentic AI’s to achieve additional efficiencies while reducing employee overhead. However, the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; outcome may be &lt;strong&gt;systems where people are still crucial, but in ways they neither anticipated nor are well-prepared for&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative AI systems have utility&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, I used several of these tools to help write this piece: asking where the central argument could be stronger, looking for related examples to address gaps, and correcting the overall grammar. And from industrial robots on assembly lines to inbox spam detection, there are copious examples of automation being a net positive in modern life; the automation doing the jobs that are either too tedious, dangerous, or unfulfilling for human effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These agents will be attempted. That bandwagon has left on &lt;del&gt;autopilot&lt;/del&gt; CoPilot™. However, as those responsible for manifesting those systems within organizations, it is imperative that we heed Bainbridge’s “Ironies of Automation” and don’t blindly automate everything. When automation is called for, we must &lt;strong&gt;keep human operators engaged through training, simulation, and periodic manual operation&lt;/strong&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;designing automation to fail in clear and obvious ways to prompt easier human interventions&lt;/strong&gt;. If we can do that, we’ll support and sustain human expertise, not erode it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-06-04&quot;&gt;Update 2025-06-04&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a recent exchange on Mastodon that, I thought, reflected this article’s premise. While linking to an article on requiring drivers in self-driving vehicles, &lt;a href=&quot;hhttps://mstdn.social/@marick/114625644030621023&quot;&gt;Brian Marick noted&lt;/a&gt;, “Is there any safety lesson more basic than ‘even trained humans are really bad at staying focused, ready to intervene, when the need for intervention is infrequent’? And yet here we are, making the same damn mistake again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triangletoot.party/@donaldball/114625808664818266&quot;&gt;Donald Ball responded&lt;/a&gt;, “These systems are lousy at producing safety but aces at producing scapegoats to serve as the accountability sink.”&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Oppose the TAKE IT DOWN Act</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There are real problems that could be addressed by new legislation. Along with ubiquitous cell phone cameras and deep fake abilities have come a rash of gross online behavior; what we might have once referred to as &lt;em&gt;revenge porn&lt;/em&gt; is now collectively referred to as non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate recently passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/146&quot;&gt;TAKE IT DOWN Act&lt;/a&gt; to address the problem. The intention is good. However, the proposed implmentation leaves much to be desired - so much so that Trump excitedly referenced wanting to use the bill to silence his past accusers during last week’s address to the joint session of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent letters to my Congressional representation voicing my concerns. The letter to Senator Amy Klobuchar, co-sponsor of the bill, is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Opposition to the Take It Down Act (S.146)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Senator Klobuchar,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Take It Down Act, which recently passed the Senate and you co-sponsored. While the bill’s stated intent- to combat non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) - is laudable, its approach is deeply flawed. As drafted, the bill creates an overbroad notice-and-takedown system with severe penalties, incentivizing platforms to remove content without meaningful review. This will not only result in abuse but will actively suppress lawful speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has happened before: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was designed to protect intellectual property, but its notice-and-takedown provisions have been repeatedly weaponized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/over-thirty-thousand-dmca-notices-reveal-an-organized-attempt-to-abuse-copyright-law&quot;&gt;Tens of thousands of fraudulent DMCA claims have been used to silence journalists, suppress negative press, and manipulate online discourse&lt;/a&gt;. The Take It Down Act creates a nearly identical system, except instead of copyright claims, it enables virtually any powerful individual or institution to demand the removal of speech they dislike under the guise of NCII complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chilling effect is obvious. Faced with a 48-hour takedown mandate and the threat of legal or financial penalty, platforms will opt to remove content immediately, even when claims are unfounded. This will disproportionately impact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survivors of abuse who use online platforms to expose their abusers&lt;/strong&gt; - This law will provide bad actors with a new tool to erase evidence of their misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalists and activists documenting abuses of power&lt;/strong&gt; - From war crimes to workplace harassment, critical reporting could be wiped from public view with a mere takedown request.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platforms already struggling to moderate content responsibly&lt;/strong&gt; - The law forces them to err further on the side of mass removal, leading to default state of over-censorship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning, &lt;strong&gt;President Trump has openly admitted that he intends to use this law for his own benefit&lt;/strong&gt;. In this year’s joint address to Congress, he stated, “And I’m going to use that bill for myself too if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.” We should work to thwart totalitarian tendencies during these unprecedented times, not further encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are better ways to combat NCII. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.missingkids.org/home&quot;&gt;The National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC)&lt;/a&gt; has already developed a voluntary, hashed-based system to help platforms identify and remove problematic content without requiring rushed, legally fraught decisions. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;StopNCII.org&quot;&gt;StopNCII.org&lt;/a&gt; has developed a robust, privacy-protecting approach that allows individuals to preemptively flag sensitive content for removal without government intervention. Groups like &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.iftas.org/&quot;&gt;Federated Trust and Safety (IFTAS)&lt;/a&gt; have compelling solutions but are struggling for support to continue their work. Strengthening these initiatives through funding or platform incentives would be far more effective than mandating a sweeping, abuse-prone legal regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I urge you to revisit your support for the Take It Down Act, work on these gaps should the opportunity arise during reconciliation, and support solutions that address the real problem without undermining fundamental freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Reinbold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-03-30&quot;&gt;Update 2025-03-30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard from several recipients, including Senator Tina Smith. She has announced that she won’t seek re-election when her term ends in 2026. However, despite her time in the Senate ending, she has continued to be personal, responsive, and articulate on the issues I’ve contacted her about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative Angie Craig, however, is another matter. Considering she has spoken in favor of the Take It Down Act, I didn’t know what to expect writing her. However, I would have had more respect for silence than the oddly phrased, generic “protecting personal data” letter I received. I understand these are busy people and I wouldn’t expect a personalized “F-U” from a bill supporter. But printing and mailing “default data pearl-clutching response #7” from the stack just makes her (and/or her staff) look that much more out of touch with the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/angie_craig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of Angie Craig&apos;s letter in response to my concerns regarding the Take It Down Act. It starts with &amp;quot;Thank you for contacting me about data privacy. I hear your concern that individuals&apos; personal data may be used without their consent.&amp;quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-04-28&quot;&gt;Update 2025-04-28&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/congress-passes-take-it-down-act-despite-major-flaws&quot;&gt;mentioned by the EFF&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. House of Representatives today passed the Take It Down act. It now moves on to be signed into law by the President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-05-15&quot;&gt;Update 2025-05-15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been weeks but I have yet to see confirmation that this has been signed. Odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2025-05-19&quot;&gt;Update 2025-05-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Monday the 19th, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/661230/trump-signs-take-it-down-act-ai-deepfakes&quot;&gt;Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The law makes publishing NCII, whether real or AI-generated, criminally punishable by up to three years in prison, plus fines. It also requires social media platforms to have processes to remove NCII within 48 hours of being notified and ‘make reasonable efforts’ to remove any copies. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with enforcing the law, and companies have a year to comply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.iftas.org/library/legal-regulatory/take-it-down-act-2025-usa/&quot;&gt;The Internet Federated Trust and Safety Group (or IFTAS) released guidance for online moderators&lt;/a&gt; on how to approach their new responsibilities under the law. This isn’t just a concern for the Instasnaps and Facetubes of the world - even moderators of individual Mastodon instances are potentially liable, as the law applies to “any online service that allows users to share or distribute user-generated content,” regardless of size or commercial status.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>On Blog Writing</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have several tepid attempts at lending some clarifying thought to (&lt;em&gt;gestures manically&lt;/em&gt;) this moment. The problem, however, is that anything I have to say feels so incredibly ineffective at stopping this slow-motion trainwreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting a pile of half-completed work make me feel inept, I decided to switch tracks to something more approachable: contributing to an old-fashioned &lt;strong&gt;blog carnival&lt;/strong&gt;. I initially saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/blog-questions-challenge/&quot;&gt;Ethan Marcotte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hicks.design/journal/blog-questions-challenge&quot;&gt;Jon Hicks&lt;/a&gt; do their versions and was then reminded about when &lt;a href=&quot;https://polytechnic.co.uk/blog/2025/02/blog-questions-challenge/&quot;&gt;Garrett Coakley&lt;/a&gt; mentioned his post on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a few answers about how and why I blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-you-start-blogging-in-the-first-place&quot;&gt;Why did you start blogging in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing has always been an essential part of how I organize my internal space. Even as a kid, rather than leave things as vague notions or incomplete thoughts, I’d attempt to articulate my feelings in cheap, spiral-bound notebooks. I wasn’t saving these scraps because I thought they were genius to be mined or affirmations to follow, but just a natural part of trying to process the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it when people started blogging online. It felt like you got such a more authentic, genuine version of the person. Don’t get me wrong, optimizing for maximum “virality” also existed then; parasocial relationships are not new, and there were plenty of “influencers” that put on a persona before laying hands on keys existed then, too. But being able to publish something immediately, worldwide, to connect with others &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; is amazing, given other forms of media and their gatekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-platform-are-you-using-to-manage-your-blog-and-why-did-you-choose-it-have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before&quot;&gt;What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place I ever posted something was a Geocities site. Then I used phpBB for a while, something that makes much more sense as a forum for a community than a blog for a single person. I used WordPress for a few years, and then hand-crafted my own CMS using Macromedia/Adobe ColdFusion and MySQL. That was fun, as I got to do some interesting experiments with tagging and automatic content embedding, but, over time, it required too much overhead to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I use Jekyll for my blog and Ghost.pro for &lt;a href=&quot;https://netapinotes.com/&quot;&gt;my API newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. I became a big believer in static site generation some time ago for several reasons, and the static files from Jekyll can easily be served for free from a GitHub Pages site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-write-your-posts-for-example-in-a-local-editing-tool-or-in-a-paneldashboard-thats-part-of-your-blog&quot;&gt;How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write anything under a few thousand words in Google Docs; it has the minimal number of features and the maximum amount of universal availability. Once I have a draft I’m pretty set on, I copy the contents into Grammarly and then review the suggestions, selectively choosing which ones to apply back to the original doc. Then I copy and paste the text into the destination vessel - markdown for the blog, or Ghost’s newsletter web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For pieces longer than a few thousand words, like presentations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview&quot;&gt;I use Scrivener&lt;/a&gt;. Scrivener helps me organize longer work into more maintainable chunks, with support for templates, research notes, slide sketch ideas, rich statistics, and more. It’s a bit much for one-off posts, but for more ambitious projects, I’ve found it to be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write&quot;&gt;When do you feel most inspired to write?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired might be the wrong word, but I know I need to write when I feel the most at a loss. Maybe others are able to go about their days with 100% certainty of who they are and what they are doing. I’m not like that, and those moments when I feel the least in control or stressed over something unclear are the moments when I’m like, “Yeah, I need to unpack this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I get a revelation or a fresh perspective. However, most of the time, just acknowledging the feeling and what might be causing it is enough to get me unstuck. I don’t think that’s the most entertaining for others to read, and usually those posts get tucked away, far from the light of the screen. And that’s OK; not everything that gets written has to be read to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit-as-a-draft&quot;&gt;Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rarely write and publish in one sitting. I’m almost always in a dialogue with the me I was yesterday (or the week before, or the month before that). So, in that sense, I let it simmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I’ve put in the hours on something I know I’ll publish, I’ll push through to completion if I’m close. After all, how else will I see those subtle errors only visible when everyone else can see them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-favorite-post-on-your-blog&quot;&gt;What’s your favorite post on your blog?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/tags/#Aesop2121&quot;&gt;“Aesop2121” utopian science fiction writing challenge I did last year&lt;/a&gt;. Having a place to post &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/tags/#Presentations&quot;&gt;my software presentations&lt;/a&gt;, which is work I put a tremendous amount of effort into, is also great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my most unapologetic, challenging, and &lt;strong&gt;favorite&lt;/strong&gt; blog post was &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2014/03/03/Her&quot;&gt;my 2014 “orthogonal” review of Spike Jonze’s Her&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a cultural and technological pathos in that movie that I connected with and wanted to embellish and accentuate; I was attempting to “vibe” with a work before that was a thing. I knew I hit my mark when one of my good friends reached out after reading it and asked if I was OK. That was a proud moment for me and remains one of my favorite things (if a bit maudlin) I’ve ever published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;any-future-plans-for-your-blog-maybe-a-redesign-a-move-to-another-platform-or-adding-a-new-feature&quot;&gt;Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no plans at the moment for my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year of attempting regular updates and specialized exclusives with my newsletter, I’ve resolved to posting when I post. The social landscape for how technical opinion is shared and promoted to broader audiences is drastically different than when I started in 2015. Frankly, I’m not sure if it makes sense any longer to log what amounts to a part-time job on such a niche topic; very few in this area seem interested in reading multi-thousand-word pieces a month. Even fewer are willing to financially support it. Whether the reason for the reception is me or the market, the bottom-line is that there are other, more enjoyable things I can do with my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whos-next&quot;&gt;Who’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will steal the idea from a few others in this series and encourage anyone writing online to &lt;em&gt;just do it&lt;/em&gt;; reflection is almost always a worthy exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you do, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opinuendo.com/@matthew&quot;&gt;ping me on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, so I can read it.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Pass the PRESS Act</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As the current congressional session begins to wind down, the PRESS ACT, which was passed unanimously by the House, is still waiting for a vote. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/its-the-senates-last-chance-to-pass-the-press-act/&quot;&gt;As described by Zack Whittiker writing on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRESS Act, if passed into law, would enshrine nationwide protections for journalists across the United States from being forced to identify or give up their confidential sources (except in emergency cases, like to prevent an act of terrorism). The bill also grants other protections, such as limiting what records the government can secretly take from journalists or their email or phone provider that could identify their sources — again, with a narrow set of exceptions for emergency threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional coverage of the PRESS Act includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom.press/issues/pass-the-press-act/&quot;&gt;Freedom of the Press Foundation’s Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spj.org/press-act.asp&quot;&gt;The Society of Professional Journalists Page (with video!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/press-act-will-protect-journalists-when-they-need-it-most&quot;&gt;Coverage by the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom of the press is a really important thing, and this should be a no-brainer!&lt;/strong&gt;. However, concerned Americans who want to see the media be able to investigate corruption and misuses of power &lt;em&gt;need to encourage their Senators to act in this 11th hour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.peoplepower.org/letter/congress-press-act#&quot;&gt;The ACLU has a convenient web form for contacting your elected official&lt;/a&gt;. While the form is expedient, I would encourage those who are able to send physical mail, ASAP. I understand that physical mail is more likely to be read, as it is a greater rarity in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-letter-that-i-sent-to-both-of-my-senators-is-below&quot;&gt;The letter that I sent to both of my senators is below.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Senator,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold and I am proud to call Woodbury, Minnesota my home. As your constituent, I am writing to urge you to prioritize bringing the PRESS Act to a vote in the Senate before the end of this year. This bipartisan bill, passed unanimously by the House in January, is a rare example of cross-party consensus on an issue central to our democracy: protecting the freedom of the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRESS Act establishes essential safeguards for journalists, preventing them from being forced to disclose the identities of their confidential sources and limiting the government’s ability to seize records that could compromise those sources. It includes thoughtful exceptions for emergencies, such as imminent threats of terrorism, ensuring national security needs are balanced with press protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without such protections, journalists risk facing a chilling effect—deterring critical investigative reporting that holds those in power accountable. At a time when press freedoms are increasingly under threat and government agencies could face mounting pressure to retaliate against watchdog journalism, the PRESS Act is not just timely but urgently necessary. It strengthens First Amendment protections that underpin our democratic system and ensures that whistleblowers and other truth-tellers can come forward without fear of exposure or retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill already has broad bipartisan support in the Senate, with sponsors including Senators Ron Wyden, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, and Dick Durbin. &lt;strong&gt;All that remains is for the Senate to take decisive action and bring it to a vote&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your constituent, I ask you to demonstrate your commitment to the principles of a free press and the protections our democracy depends on. Please do everything in your power to ensure the PRESS Act reaches the Senate floor and becomes law before the year ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I am grateful for your service to Minnesota and your dedication to preserving our democracy in the face of potential adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Reinbold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2025-01-07&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did hear from Senator Tina Smith shortly after holiday break. While her email was short and explained that the bill was currently in the judiciary committee, which she wasn’t part of, she expressed her support for it if or when it was brought to the floor for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Thank You, Tim</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up on a farm, I learned just how stressful harvest time is at an early age. There is a very narrow window during which it is possible to maximize your returns. Go too early, and you risk spoilage. Wait until too late, and you end up leaving money in the field. And that all depends on whether the weather holds. Mistime any of those things, and you have to wait until next spring (and another six-figure seed bill) for another chance to make things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, I can recall multiple times when my Dad and other farmers in our small town (population of 440) would drop whatever they were doing to help someone in need. Sometimes it would be broken equipment (sunflowers have a nasty habit of setting themselves and the combine that is harvesting them on fire). Other times it would be a medical emergency. Regardless of the context, the community would ensure that the crop made it in because that’s what being a good neighbor was about. It is about the decency and dignity we owe each other, freely given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating college, my family and I have lived in several places. However, it was when we moved back to Minnesota that I felt that familiar sense of shared responsibility. People throw around abstract terms, like “community”, because they sound good. But I’m increasingly convinced few have first-hand, &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; experiences with what it means to be a good neighbor, or participate, sometimes at your own peril, in &lt;strong&gt;mutual aid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Governor Tim Walz was thrust into the national spotlight, I was delighted he used his platform to share and celebrate the Minnesota brand of “neighborly” the upper Midwest and Great Plains practice. The results of the U.S. Presidential election turned out differently than I had hoped. I’ll be processing that for some time to come. However, providing hope is always worthwhile, and I felt moved to thank Governor Walz for representing Minnesota as he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of the letter that I dropped in the mail today is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Governor Walz,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine the past several months have been a whirlwind, and I hope you’re finding moments to recover. Before the moment passes, I wanted to take a moment to thank you—not only for making Minnesota a place my family is proud to call home but also for running a presidential campaign with Kamala Harris that inspired hope, appealed to our better natures, and, above all, &lt;strong&gt;embraced joy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the short amount of time America had to get to know you, you became known as the ambassador for &lt;em&gt;Minnesota nice&lt;/em&gt;, an alternative example of &lt;em&gt;modern masculinity&lt;/em&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;America’s Dad&lt;/em&gt;. As a father of four, I’m exhausted just contemplating that last one. But you energetically took all that on, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I both grew up in South Dakota and spent two decades living across the country—Salt Lake City, Denver, and Washington, D.C. When the pandemic gave us the chance to relocate, we carefully weighed our options and ultimately chose to call Woodbury home. It was a big change, filled with the usual uncertainties. However, Minnesota has wildly exceeded our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebration and preservation of natural beauty, strong support for public schools, and a shared commitment to treating others with &lt;strong&gt;decency&lt;/strong&gt;—no matter their gender, creed, or circumstances—are core values that you and other leaders have turned into policy. Among a statewide commitment to being &lt;em&gt;good neighbors&lt;/em&gt;, we have thrived. Thank you for being such a vital part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent election results were disappointing in many ways. I worry about what the future holds for our allies abroad and our already imperfect institutions at home. Still, as my wife said this weekend, “At least Tim is still our governor.” That’s no small sliver of a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you continued success and hope you and your family find peace and rest in the months ahead. Thank you for representing the very best of what Minnesota has to offer—and for inspiring us all to be better neighbors and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Reinbold&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Surviving the Turbo Encabulator</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an honor to be asked back to speak at DevOps Days. Two years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2022/06/28/SevenSkillsToSaveSoftware&quot;&gt;I covered seven soft skills for making software change happen&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, during the heights of generative AI hype, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2023/06/23/SeparatingAIFactFromFiction&quot;&gt;I did a deep dive showing practical ways generative AI could assist API development&lt;/a&gt;. This year, maybe more than any previous year, I have to wade through propaganda, misinformation, and outright lies - and I’m not talking about the election!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than any other industry, software is drowning in bold &lt;strong&gt;claims&lt;/strong&gt;, wild speculation, and outright exaggeration. These muddied messages about what is and is not effective impact our ability to do our best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say &lt;strong&gt;claim&lt;/strong&gt;, I refer to a statement or assertion that promises specific benefits, capabilities, or outcomes. These claims are typically used to generate excitement, attract investment, or even sow confusion. They range from a modest list of apparent facts to grandiose statements about revolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I’ll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce you to the claims made by the Turbo Encabulator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain why this 80-year-old engineering in-joke is more relevant to our age than ever before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use examples from it and other sources to illustrate the techniques and outline how we might better evaluate the claims that come our way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the Turbo Encabulator relevance to our work today, we first need a bit of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1944, a British engineering grad student named John Hellins Quick wrote an article for the Institute of Electrical Engineers, Students Quarterly Journal. His studies inspired the satirical description of a revolutionary technology comprised of long strings of meaningless jargon. It went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-bovoid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the “up” end of the grammeters-“
— &lt;em&gt;John Hellins Quick, 2nd paragraph of “The turbo-encabulator in industry”, Students’ Quarterly Journal, Vol. 15, Iss. 58, p. 22 (December 1944)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went on like this for several additional paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War II brought rapid advancements in electronics, computing, and telecommunications. Post-war Great Britain was not the only country transformed (and, ultimately, having to adapt) to increase technology sophistication. In the United States, industries were just as impacted. And, like Great Britain, those in the United States challenged to comprehend technobabble and jargon found the Turbo Encabulator just as funny. Or at least some did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 1946, Time magazine published excerpts from the article under the title, “For Nofer Trunnions”. Reader feedback was mixed. One letter said, “&lt;strong&gt;My husband says it sounds like a new motor; I say it sounds like a dictionary that has been struck by lightning.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1962, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_encabulator#/media/File:GE_Turboencabulator_pg_1.jpg&quot;&gt;General Electric even published a data specification sheet for the machine&lt;/a&gt;, including a plausible-looking write-up amidst its other hundreds of offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator might have been a curious footnote in the annuals of engineering history (or at least an even more obscure one) if not for an instructional film actor named Bud Haggart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haggart became a minor celebrity in the Detroit area for appearing in several automotive information and instruction videos. One of his regular gigs was doing how-tos for GMC mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Haggart convinced the director and the crew to stay after the recording of a GMC Trucks training film. He wanted to record his version of the Turbo Encabulator. The “script”  Haggart ad-libbed in one take was based on the original John Hellings Quick article. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag&quot;&gt;That original recording can be found on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It amazed the crew, who you can hear laughing at the end of the piece. They asked Haggart how he could read the script with such a straight face. Haggart replied that “It sounds like everything else you have me read.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haggart was asked to reprise the role several times in subsequent years, each time with increased production value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1988 - A few years later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXW0bx_Ooq4&quot;&gt;Chrysler brought Haggart in to film a new version of his Turbo Encabulator, but this time, the script was changed to imply that the company had made the device&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1988 - Not wanting to be left out, Rockwell International, an American automotive manufacturing conglomerate (among other things) asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fjcJp_Nwvk&quot;&gt;Haggart to pitch a “Rockwell Turbo Encabulator”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1996/1997 - Haggart (and slapstick assistant) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRllRWfLJE&quot;&gt;deliver a version of the Turbo Encabulator for Dodge Division’s Viper Automotive Master Tech Tip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of these skits, preserved on YouTube and propagated across the internet via social media, chats, and forums ultimately inspired imitators, a brief sampling of which is below. Once you watch a few of these and trigger the algorithm to show you related videos, you quickly realize there’s an entire “Encabulator Cinematic Universe,” or ECU, for nearly every industry, interest, and profession - a brief sampling is listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;2023 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk8_RWO-oIA&quot;&gt;The crazy legal issues of the turbo encabulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator has found purchase in areas as diverse as photo gear vlogs and science education curricula because technology has infused so many aspects of our modern, everyday lives. As the need for change incentivizes products to move from rigid atoms to malleable bits, we find ourselves constantly confronted with the kind of technobabble and jargon that sounds straight out of one of the many Turbo Encabulator homages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the pace of change hasn’t sped up over the last century, &lt;strong&gt;not really&lt;/strong&gt;. However, what has changed is the amount of information exposure we undergo daily, and with that exposure comes an incredible number of claims. Blogs, websites, social networks, podcasts, tutorials, videos - in an era of sophisticated “content marketing”, the amount of potential information you have access to far exceeds the amount of time you have available to consume it. And on the internet, anyone can make claims - right, wrong, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is a chart showing that the number of hours uploaded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/&quot;&gt;YouTube every minute exceeded &lt;strong&gt;500 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This equates to &lt;em&gt;approximately 30,000 hours of newly uploaded content per hour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right is a chart showing the growth of posts made to Reddit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/reddit-users&quot;&gt;In 2023, an estimated 469 million posts were published on Reddit, an 11.14% year-over-year increase.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide10-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everybody making all those claims, it becomes more challenging to be heard. As a result, those with something to say must resort to increasingly Turbo Encabulator-like approaches to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why so much of what you might hear about today’s technologies sounds like an excerpt from the Turbo Encabultor script. You’d be forgiven for thinking these real claims, things I’ve seen in the past week, is jibberish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While handling APIs using AGI is not feasible at this time, employing an ANI approach can lead to very powerful M2M APIs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem is fundamentally anchored in the decentralized consensus mechanism inherent to blockchain technology, specifically leveraging the immutability of distributed ledgers to authenticate and tokenize unique digital assets. NFTs exist as cryptographically secured, ERC-721 or ERC-1155 smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, although cross-chain interoperability with other Layer-1 protocols like Binance Smart Chain and Solana is increasingly prevalent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Private AI x CPaas offer on-premise LLM deployment for organizations to ensure data privacy and security while leveraging the power of modern LLMs and Generative AI through platforms like Ollama. This solution would include on-premise (or collocated) deployment, customizable AI models tailored to organizational needs, robust security measures, easy integration with existing systems, and continuous deployment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide10-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, ridiculous, over-the-top claims have become LinkedIn “influencer’s” stock-and-trade. Good for them. Confusing for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we would have the time, energy, and inclination to develop firsthand experience with these various technologies. However, applying that rigor to compare and contrast what is said against our hard-won knowledge doesn’t scale to the number of claims we’re faced with. This is especially true as our careers grow and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether moving into higher management roles or becoming deeply specialized individual contributors, the reality is that we are no longer hands-on with every tool and innovation shaping online discourse. This occurs as we are tasked with guiding our teams and making strategic decisions about these approaches - approaches we may have only a surface-level understanding of if any at all. This disconnect poses one of the most significant challenges aging software professionals face—how to effectively evaluate and make informed decisions about technologies they no longer have the time or capacity to master firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach would become cynical: when confronted by the overwhelming number of claims, adopt a mindset that there is nothing new and that whatever the first technology we professionally mastered is the peak of practice - everything else is just unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that some of these recent “Make X Great Again” efforts aren’t without good reasons. However, if you read enough of the justifications, you’ll get a whiff of sour grapes, the hint of “everything was better in the old days”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts that come to mind include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trunk Based Development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanilla JavaScript/No-React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloud Repatriation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving back to Monolithic architectures after trying Microservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sympathize. Nobody wants to invest their energies into something that becomes the next Google Wave or Microsoft Silverlight. The cynical approach is also straightforward to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the danger of adopting a cynical outlook and rejecting all claims outright is that it risks missing profound and industry-altering changes - and while that doesn’t happen as often as some might claim, &lt;em&gt;it does happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating Turbo Encabulator-like technobabble in claims, our old frames of reference might not always apply. What was once true in the past may not hold true in a different software paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flimflam is not new. But the democratization of the internet means there are more claims than ever, with those with something to say working harder than ever to get their message heard above the crowd. That saturation necessitates that we, those of us in all manner of tech leadership, become more active as consumers - not passive conduits for the vendor, analyst, and consultant messages, but people making informed judgments of what we do see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating new claims becomes an exercise in discerning meaningful innovation from marketing-driven hype—a skill that must be honed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating a convoluted claim, the first step is approaching with a healthy dose of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should point out that skepticism is not the same as cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy skepticism involves questioning and critically assessing claims, seeking evidence and reasoning before accepting them. Skeptics remain open-minded and willing to change their views if presented with compelling evidence. This approach helps evaluate technology claims objectively, without being swayed by hype or marketing, while still considering potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, cynicism tends to dismiss claims outright, often assuming that they are exaggerated or false without engaging in critical evaluation. Cynics generally expect deception or failure, and their approach is more closed off, making it harder for them to acknowledge the value of genuinely promising technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, skepticism is about informed doubt and a willingness to engage critically, while cynicism is about premature dismissal and a more negative, closed mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all sources are the same, and some warrant a higher degree of skepticism than others. We know (or should know) that the claim that gets the most shares or comments is not equivalent to something with the highest quality. Likewise, something published on InfoQ may be taken on more face value than whatever is at the top of HackerNews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of developing our list of trusted sources, it is also important to incorporate sources of information that will offer new perspectives and challenge our own assumptions. It is not a matter of picking fights; rather, it is about getting out of our own “filter bubble”. This may feel uncomfortable at first. However, if we’re will to entertain the claims of something potentially disruptive, we may discover that those claims may be bogus, and we have further confirmation in our own belief. Or we may find a compelling reason to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the curation of trusted sources is about practicing curiosity and self-challenge. That’s what learning is all about. You can’t understand the world, or even a tiny part of it if you don’t stretch your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies resort to hyperbolic claims to be heard in a noisy, crowded digital landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand how this inflation manifests to identify when it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we attend conferences or scroll through influencer LinkedIn, we’ve probably heard of “Buzzword Bingo.” To help us remember the common linguistic patterns used in claims that are more “vibes” than communication, I’ve grouped the techniques into categories that spell “B-I-N-G-O.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help illustrate each, I’m going to highlight the parts of the Turbo Encabulator script where each rhetorical device is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide18-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter “B” in Bingo stands for Buzzwords. Buzzwords are popular terms or phrases used so frequently, often in a positive or promotional context, that they lose their original meaning or become vague. They are meant to grab attention and sound appealing but may not provide much specific information. For example, words like “innovative”, “disruptive”, or “synergistic” might be used to describe almost any new idea or technology, even if it doesn’t truly revolutionize anything. Phrases like “game-changing,” “future-proof,” or “industry-leading” often sound impressive until one stops a moment to reflect on what game or industry is being talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide18-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://netapinotes.com/rest-has-become-a-buzzword/&quot;&gt;I wrote about Fielding’s disallusionment of of how the term “REST” became a buzzword, despite his vigorous defense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, we all probably understand buzzwords and have a few examples that spring to mind. Let’s move on to our next category, which is a bit more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide19-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “I” in Bingo represents “Implausible Promises”. These are over-the-top claims about what technology can do, like “limitless potential”, or “effortless transformation.” Other examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completely eliminate risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet any demand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transform your business overnight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Results guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Endless possibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each of these, there’s an absolutism to the benefit - “limitless”, “any”, “endless” - that rarely exists in the real world. If you can add “or your money back” to the claim, what you have is an infomercial, not a viable claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide19-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend any amount of time in the blockchain/crypto game space, it doesn’t take long to run across an “implausible promise”. But reading about the aftermath does make for some fun &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide20-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of absolute quantities, the “N” in Bingo stands for “Numeric Certainty”. This situation is where dubious statistics or metrics are sprinkled throughout the claim to give the language a veneer of mathematical rigor. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double Your Performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10x Developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;300% ROI Increase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Five nines”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Ever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, numbers associated with a claim are valid and based on repeatable methodology. When misused, however, they are either exaggerated or cherry-picked to impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide20-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numeric certainty appeals to a very specific type of reply guy on miniblogging platforms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandofsky.com/lambda-school/&quot;&gt;The misuse of statistics made on Twitter claims played a important part in the Lambda school scandal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide21-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “G” in Bingo stands for “Glossification”. This is when new words are coined to “borrow” a positive associate with another thing, whether that thing is another beloved trend or well-received product. It’s like the trend of startup companies registering ‘.io’ domain names in the 2010s to imply how innovative or tech-forward they are. Nowadays, the “cool” domain is “.ai.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s and 1980s, Microsoft was not the only software company that sported the “soft” suffix to clearly attach itself to the personal computing software wave. Twenty years ago, you’d add an “e” to your product to connote that it was somehow networked. In the iPod era, many companies prefixed their products with “I” to evoke the positive aspects of Apple’s industrial design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Crypto” is a habitually abused glossification prefix. Terms like “HyperScale” or “Serverless” are other examples of glossification that aren’t brand names. The addition of “Turbo” in “Turbo Encabulator” is an example of glossification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide21-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But glossification isn’t limited to written language. Borrowing positive connotations extends to body language, as well. But just because a company leader talks like someone with immense impact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-more-11-years-defrauding-theranos-investors-hundreds&quot;&gt;doesn’t mean the tech can walk the walk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re to the final character in Bingo. The “O” stands for “Obfuscation”. Obfuscation uses overly complex or technical-sounding language to confuse or impress, often hiding a lack of real substance. It’s designed to make something sound more advanced or important than it really is. Examples include phrases like “leveraging multi-cloud quantum synergies” or “immutable distributed ledgers” - things that may sound impressive but don’t necessarily convey meaningful or clear information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obfuscation is a close cousin, but different than buzzwords. Buzzwords are overused, trendy terms that no longer have specific meanings. Obfuscation, on the other hand, is about using complexity to obscure or confuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Green is the author of many books, including The Fault In Our Stars. He is also one-half of the Vlogbrothers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd8r7LUiUJA&quot;&gt;While playfully discussing parts of speech&lt;/a&gt;, he stated, “language doesn’t exist to oppress us. It exists to promote the clarity of expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, not every one that speaks seeks to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator is an eighty-year-old engineering joke whose jargon-filled meaninglessness cuts too close to home. Technobabble is even more challenging today in a world of claims and counterclaims. However, with a few commonsense steps, including the ability to recognize the rhetorical tricks as they’re presented, you’ll be able to enjoy the joke rather than become the butt of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide24.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the time and the opportunity to share.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Flies and the Honeypot</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;While technology may change, human behavior does not. At least, that’s what reading the collection of Aesop’s Fables suggests. The characters and motivations in the parables, attributed to Aesop after he died in 564 BCE, remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesop 2021 projects these well-known (and not-so-known) stories into an age only a stone’s throw from our own. When cynicism and pessimism abound, hope becomes a rebellious act against the tyranny of the default. Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aesop 2021 project is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.writinganalytics.co/challenge/65de2439a653549bd3537227&quot;&gt;Never Break the Chain March Writing Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The original sources were translated by George Fyler Townsend and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/21/pg21-images.html#link2H_4_0077&quot;&gt;provided under the Project Gutenberg license&lt;/a&gt;. Addition reference provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.gov/aesop/about.html&quot;&gt;a Library of Congress interactive book&lt;/a&gt; adapted from the public domain book “The Aesop for Children: with Pictures by Milo Winter,” published by Rand, McNally &amp;amp; Co in 1919.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;below-is-the-latest-installment&quot;&gt;Below is the latest installment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/honey.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concordance Day, 2121, dawned bright and arid. It was a holiday to celebrate the Grand New Deal and repent for the sins of centuries past’s ancestors. Achieving consensus, some might argue &lt;em&gt;enlightenment&lt;/em&gt;, had come at great expense during the Billionaires’ War. The day’s gatherings, music, play, and more - marking the moment to remember &lt;em&gt;what might have been&lt;/em&gt; and expressing gratitude for &lt;em&gt;what had become&lt;/em&gt; was no small undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began with sunrise services, during which people were encouraged to ponder the sacrifices made to ensure humanity’s health and happiness. The meditative time closed with a blessing for sustainability and mutual respect for all, an allusion to “The Pivot” becoming “The Promise”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community productions and interactive retellings follow a hearty breakfast. Historians, ecologists, and storytellers of all skills portray the past’s excesses. They speak of bleached ocean coral, forests razed for palm oil, and children who went thirsty while data centers drank freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dueted stories each year is that of &lt;strong&gt;The Flies and The Honey-Pot&lt;/strong&gt;. What once was considered a children’s fable has now become a regular highlight, as the recording of each truthsayers version is uploaded and added to, in near real-time; a modern world-wide story circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard version, flies discover a jar of honey spilled in the storeroom. Ecstatic over their luck, they land and begin eating greedily, not realizing that their feet have become stuck in the process. Unable to release themselves, they lament their fate before suffocating - giving their lives for a passing taste of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least that’s the start. Some give the flies different voices. Others, as they are able, act out the scene. And still others animate or compose, assigning import to historical events. The fate that finds us, greed, and the ultimate consequences are told again and again so as not to forget just how precariously close humanity had come to a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the afternoon grows long, the tone shifts to celebration of the great change: uplifting praise of the collective action that closed holes in the ozone layer, universalized healthcare, and reforested vast swathes of Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bioluminescent lights begin to glow, people bid each farewell and retire to their homes. After Concordance Day, they’ll continue on the difficult but necessary journey towards a better world, one that is more sustainable, equitable, and hopeful. They’ll do so not with scorn or damnation of the past but with gratitude that they have the opportunity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, indulgence in excess can lead to one’s downfall. The pursuit of immediate gratification may come at the expense of one’s well-being or survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/strong&gt;
That concludes the March Writing Challenge and, with it, Aesop 2121.
