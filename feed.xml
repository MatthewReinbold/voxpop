I also write the 'Net API Notes' email  newsletter and curate NetAPI.events. Much of what appears here dated prior to 2017 was  previously published at VoxPop.co and VoxPopDesign.com. There's also a bit  of legacy detritus from older experiments like mutednoise.com,  miltiantgeek.com, codeaway.org, etc. Adult fan of Lego. And trying to make Dakota Gothic a thing.

        <title>APIs are Arrangements of Power</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented “APIs are Arrangements of Power” at the 2020 APIDays Interface conference. It was my first virtual conference and a very different experience. How I prepared for that context is a different article. For now, the slides and script are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-02.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I am Matthew Reinbold&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone. I hope that you and yours are healthy and safe during this interesting time. If there is a sliver of a silver lining to all of this, I think it’s doing things like this gives some extra context and insight into the type of people you might otherwise only interact with online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my workshop and creative space. My name is Matthew Reinbold. As was mentioned, I work for Capital One. I am the Director of the Platform Services Center of Excellence. That’s a lot of words. It means that my team and I work with our 9000+ developers on thousands of APIs that answer 3.5 billion calls a day. It is a large ecosystem that we steward. We’re also increasingly involved with things like standards and processes and training around data transformation and event streaming. It is a role that cuts across the entire company and collaborates with numerous disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also write &lt;a href=&quot;http://netapinotes.com/&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;, a regular, weekly email newsletter that just celebrated five years. There I chronicle the comings and going of an industry in flux. Talking about one API, or even a handful is one thing. The challenge of managing thousands is something different. I’ve seen what it takes to go from API theory to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to find me, along with a hashtag for social media, is in the footer of each slide so we can continue the conversation even after my time is up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-03.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of blog posts, videos, and presentations - some at this very conference - that go DEEP on technical &lt;em&gt;and tactical&lt;/em&gt; aspects of delivering APIs. That is useful. However, many of us who have been involved in the space for a while have realized that just cargo-culting someone else’s tech stack isn’t enough to guarantee success. Just because you’ve implemented all of Netflix’s open-source projects or replicated Amazon’s cloud infrastructure doesn’t mean you’re going to be successful in delivering business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because APIs are more than just technology. It has so much more to do with how an API strategy manifests within the people responsible for carrying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone that cares about creating better, more well-designed software - not just APIs. To do that, we’re going to have to architect people, not only machines. And, in the process, perhaps redefine your expectations of the role API governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-04.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 1: The Power of Organizations on Architecture&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-05.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Conway's Law&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Melvin Conway published a paper entitled “How do Committees Invent?”. He proposed that the way that an organization was arranged directly and dramatically affects how software is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That early anecdotal observation was later supported by quantitative research. It stated that: 
Organizational distribution and product modularity are correlated
Products really do end up looking like the teams that create them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a company has two development teams that rarely talked with one another: one supporting the warehouse and another supporting the back office. If you set out on an API journey, Conway’s Law predicts that the resulting architecture from those teams would consist of two APIs: one for the warehouse, one for the back office. This despite the fact an external 3rd party wishes to integrate with your single company, not your org chart parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-06.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Code Quality&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the organizational arrangement doesn’t just affect modularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It turns out that organizational complexity is also the greatest determining factor for how buggy a piece of code is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more complex the organization is (due, in part, to how removed decision-makers are from implementors) the worse the code is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-influence-of-organizational-structure-on-software-quality-an-empirical-case-study/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Research Study&lt;/a&gt; mentioned here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Delivery Performance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations, published in 2018, cited organization arrangement as a key contributor to achieving delivery performance as well as for whether the engineering organization can scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If we achieve a loosely-coupled, well-encapsulated architecture with an organizational structure to match we can achieve better delivery performance… and substantially grow the size of the engineering organization and increase product lineraly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-08.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Morale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Topologies is another book dedicated to organizational arrangements. It also happens to be the best API book that I’ve read thus far this year, despite not marketing itself as an API book. The authors agree that it isn’t just getting the technology right. Designing the organization that utilizes that technology is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Never before has explicit sociotechnical design been so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say more on that $5 word, “sociotechnical”, in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-09.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Accounts for 90 or 95 Percent of Performance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W. Edwards Deming was an American engineer and management consultant. He is often credited as one of the inspirations for the Japanese post-war economic miracle of the 1950s. When it came to organizational arrangements, Deming said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fact is that the system that people work in and the interaction with people may account for 90 or 95 percent of performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about cargo-culting, when I talk about those teams that take everything that Netflix has done and jam it into production, when I talk about turning on every toggle in the AWS interface in the hopes of achieving the same kind of success I talk about failure to acknowledge what Deming says. It is one thing to imitate the technology. However, that is such a small aspect of what it takes to deliver value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing better APIs means first recognizing, then addressing Conway’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Three Ways Conway's Law Affects API Governance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this presentation to be additive. I want it to build on stuff that is already out there. That does mean that it comes with a bit of homework if you’re interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2016 API Strat Conference, I presented “&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;3 Ways Conway’s Law Affects API Governance&lt;/a&gt;”. In that talk I gave three different ways the organizational makeup affects the API design. If you are passionate about this stuff, I encourage you to seek that out and learn how hierarchy, geographical organization, and 3rd party lines of communication end up changing the API design in specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-11.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;buffer's story is one of organizational arrangement&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to provide at least one new example, as well. That comes from Buffer. Buffer is a social network management platform. In late 2015, Buffer acquired Respondly, software that enabled social media teams to respond to customers. Buffer’s technical leadership now found themselves managing two monolith architectures. These two products, Buffer and Respondly, were not connected in any way. Despite offering complimentary products, the organization’s arrangement meant there were significant challenges to delivering business value. The organizational communication structure was negatively impacting the ability to provide obvious customer value that spanned both offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, Buffer re-imagined itself as a platform that would support multiple complementary products. The technical team realigned themselves into groups responsible for core functionalities: billing, sessions, centralized storage of a user’s social media account connections. On top of that they reorganized both their architecture and additional teams around customer’s jobs-to-be-done: Publish, Reply, and Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver the most value to the consumer, Buffer needed to change its architecture, which necessitated a change to its organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The buffer story comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://increment.com/software-architecture/case-studies-in-rearchitecting/&quot;&gt;this Increment.com article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-12.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 2: The Power of Architectures On Organizations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-13.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Developers Are Doing Just As Much Work in Building Companies As Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that the arrangement of the organization, specifically how it communicates, impacts how software is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can we go the other way? Can the architecture drive organizational change? Or does it always have to start with the organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis is a data scientist and technology essayist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/p/taking-the-shine-off-the-apple-and&quot;&gt;In her June 6th newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Something happened in the last 30 years where developers transformed from some nerds sitting in the company’s basement, to the driving force of the company itself. Developers now have a lot of power, and, consequently, are doing just as much work in building companies as in building the code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feng shui is a design practice that attempts to use the arrangement of objects to harmonize people in their surroundings. Likewise, APIs are an arrangement of power. Designed with purpose, the arrangements have the power to shape organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-14.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sociotechnical Systems Optimize Both People and Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing arrangements with purpose is not a new concept. The relationship between people and systems has been studied for some time. The field of Sociotechnical Systems Engineering dates back to World War II. The word “sociotechnical”, which I mentioned earlier, refers to the interrelatedness of an organization’s social and technical aspects. It seeks to optimize both the people and machine in order to improve performance and work-life quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a sociotechnical system approach, an API practice attempts to identify the systematic power arrangements that exist within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, these factors can have an enormous impact on the software produced. And yet, if it is as powerful as I suggest, why do we so rarely see this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-15.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;You Can't Out-Tool a People Problem&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to speculate, I would guess that the messy, complicated work with people is something outside of most engineer’s training? Or, perhaps, it is something that is derisively regulated to “the humanities”. Or maybe it is because people are used to thinking about individual pieces, and rarely of a system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasons, given the power that organizational arrangements have to deliver quality code, that is a shame. It is also a vast, untapped area of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donella Meadows was one of the foremost system thinkers. In her both her educational work and book, “Thinking in Systems”, she repeatedly impressed the importance of communication above all else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labour, or technology. It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and to seek the truth rather than seek to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;this is why cargo-culting fails&lt;/strong&gt;. All the importing of another company’s open-source toolkits, their deployment playbooks, and their tech does nothing to address the interpersonal-communication of the groups implementing them. Said another way, it doesn’t matter how silver the bullet is if the gun continues to misfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-16.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 3: The Inverse Conway Maneuver&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using architecture as a beachhead for changing the organization has a name. The Inverse Conway Maneuver is where the architectural needs required for consistent, cohesive design and fast flow are considered first. The organization, subsequently, is built around that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@hkbobfsh&quot;&gt;Bob Fisher&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-17.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Change Happens&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change happens all the time, even to organizational arrangements. Sometimes it is not the way we want it. Sometimes it is not at our preferred pace. But change occurs in ways both tiny and epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apocryphal story of the Bezos memo is one such example. As the story goes, one day in 2003, Jeff Bezos required that everyone create API interfaces for their services. Anyone who didn’t do so would be fired. If that sounds harsh, it is ok; the email ended with Bezos wishing the recipient a lovely day. Kind of a passive-aggressive thing going on there, but it seems to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That change in how the organization communicated among itself set the stage for AWS. The Bezos memo stated that the company needed to change its architecture to take the organization to where it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as head of Amazon, Jeff Bezos had the hierarchical power to declare that kind of change. Where do you begin if you’re somewhere else other than the top within the org?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this is a big topic, and there is only so much I can cover in a 20-minute conversation. The road you will travel is dependent on your context. However, I want to briefly cover two useful approaches in the time we have left. They are (1) &lt;strong&gt;Shrinking the Change&lt;/strong&gt; and (2) &lt;strong&gt;Scripting the Critical Moves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;Story of the Amazon memo told here: https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/&quot;&gt;Origins of the Bezos Memo&lt;/a&gt; are available online)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-18.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shrink the Change&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two techniques I’m covering are from a book I have pictured here, called &lt;strong&gt;Switch&lt;/strong&gt;. I highly recommend it not just for these two approaches but also for the number of illustrative cases it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first technique is &lt;em&gt;shrinking the change&lt;/em&gt;. Upending organizational arrangements might be necessary. But starting with an intent that large will be met with proportional resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, shrink the change and, in the process, you’ll shrink the likelihood that people will say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change an organization? Start with your line of business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your line of business? Start with your program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your program? Start with your team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your team arrangement? Start with how (and whom) you communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of this is about the complexity of our daily communication. How regularly do the API implementation teams talk with the primary stakeholders? Are their intermediaries involved? Do groups talk past each other while emailing attachments? Are the same people always at the table? Or are new pathways being forged by the purposeful and ongoing discovery on your part? Are you building relationships in places where none existed before, are new opportunities presenting themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if through informal conversations, &lt;strong&gt;changing access to information is a precursor to those affordances being codified in an interface&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also the first step to organizational change. It can also be as simple as buying someone a coffee or (these days) having a video meet-n-greet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-19.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Script the Critical Moves&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to script the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, especially during a global pandemic, don’t have a tremendous amount of bandwidth for the unknown. We are dealing with unprecedented, low-level, and persistent stresses. The ambiguity of the unknown saps our energy and lessens the likelihood of new pursuits. The appetite for the potentially ambiguous just isn’t there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, providing the explicit, incremental steps for change may be necessary. A level of prescriptive detail lightens the lift for, otherwise, distracted, distraught, and disengaged teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m currently working on with James Higginbotham is a prescriptive process for teams to design bounded contexts. There is an ocean of tips and techniques out there for how to do this already. However, right now, for our audience,  telling people to boil that body of water to find something pure that works for them is too much. We need to script the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are alternatives to what is in the prescriptive plan. Perhaps some of those alternatives might be better in certain contexts. For those that don’t have the bandwidth for that exploration, however, we’re providing a roadmap to get them moving. We’re attempting to make getting started as easy as possible. We’re scripting the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned the Team Topology book earlier. I appreciated this book because it takes an infinite number of team arrangements and asserts four specific, followable team types. There may be other arrangements. Your mileage may vary. However, for those looking for an example organizational structures, the Team Topology book is also an example of scripted critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-20.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Git Gud at the Peoples&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get real for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know changing organizations may not have been what you signed up for when you assumed responsibility for your APIs. I suspect that the reason you chose software development was the hard certainty of 1s and 0s, rather than swishy, unpredictable nature of the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem. We spend thousands of dollars on ongoing training. We accumulate hours and hours of precious time getting certified and accredited. Back when it was still a thing, we even traveled across continents to learn the esoteric ins and outs from others. Yet, when it comes to interpersonal communication, the &lt;strong&gt;thing that we do every day&lt;/strong&gt;, we can’t be bothered to Google improvements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deal with people. We spend our time and budget optimizing machines, but it is the people that matter. It is the people that determine the success or failure of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with people to build a better organizational structure &lt;em&gt;is a skill like any other&lt;/em&gt;. It can be learned, but only when our API designers and architects stop ending at the interface and start sociotechnical entrepreneurship. Your organization’s ability to deliver business value reliably, scalably, in the face of accelerating change depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is not Kubernetes. Change is not a service mesh. Change happens with people. That is why it is time to git gud on the peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@nickxshotz&quot;&gt;Nicholas Green&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-21.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 4: Conclusion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-22.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;API Governance is a Sociotechnical Function&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to software systems, many conclude that API governance is a checklist, or a set of rules that must be applied. While the enforcement of common practice on something like an OpenAPI description of intent might be a tactic of governance, it is not a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance broadly refers to who decides what is in a platform’s ecosystem. Said more generally, &lt;strong&gt;governance is a framework for how we choose to co-exist&lt;/strong&gt;. Checking for naming inconsistencies and implementation detail leakage out through the interface is one thing. I’m challenging you to get to a higher level. That level is to be a conscientious creator of organizational arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invitation to co-create these arrangements changes the way information flows in a company. Changing the way communication flows is a precursor for changing behavior, and changing behavior is a precursor for changing the organization itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book “Platform Ecosystems: Aligning Architecture, Governance, and Strategy” has a number of profound statements on this area. The chief one is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The architecture of a platform is inseparable from how it ought to be governed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the real power of API governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-23.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Further Reading&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many books in this space. If you are interested in work being done around organizational arrangements and their effect on value creation check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accelerate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking in Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a fair amount written on change management. Many of them are related to individuals but the ones that I’ve listed here can also apply to organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agendashift: Outcome-Orientated Change and Continuous Transformation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More Fearless Change: Strategies for Making Your Ideas Happen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiny Habits&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>API Management Questions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/05/library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Media organized at a local thrift store.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organization of digital assets is as important as physical ones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-introduction&quot;&gt;Background Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam DuVander, a Portland raconteur and all-around good fellow reached out several months ago. He was writing an article and hoped I could answer a few questions on enterprise API management. A few of my quotes, along with insight from a handful of others, have since been posted in a piece entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://stoplight.io/blog/api-experts-share-how-to-organize-thousands-of-apis-and-microservices/&quot;&gt;API Experts Share How They Organize Thousands of APIs and Microservices&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choicest bits made it into the piece. However, behind the scenes, I bloviated enough to populate a standalone piece. Here’s the entirety of my replies, tweaked and updated for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions have to do with how companies manage their &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; API portfolios. These are collections that, particularly in the age of microservices, grow at exponential rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q1-how-does-an-engineer-discover-what-internal-apis-already-exist&quot;&gt;Q1: How does an engineer discover what internal APIs already exist?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API architectures are useful for several reasons. Benefits include organizing the complexity of an enterprise environment, allowing for independent deployment, dividing labor, and achieving faster times to market. Despite these advantages, however, moving from monolithic software deployment does cause discovery problems. Where there was once a single mass to inspect, there are now many homunculi to track down and interview. This is a problem, regardless of the development shop size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A centralized API registry for service discovery should be the source of truth. This single catalog not only benefits integrators looking to kickstart new experiences; it also is vital for data and regulatory appeasement (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act&quot;&gt;CCPA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Luis Weir points out in his book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Management-Luis-Augusto-Weir/dp/1787284433&quot;&gt;Enterprise API Management&lt;/a&gt;”, many companies, unfortunately, don’t have this single portal discovery experience. The discovery process, in these orgs, relies on tribal knowledge and shared spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One needs to design the discovery experience, not just for external APIs, but for internal ones, as well. There are many examples, often retold, for excellent external experiences. What isn’t covered nearly as much is the &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; discovery experience. Whether this is a dedicated portal meticulously maintained by a dedicated platform team or a list (or list of lists) of APIs in a spreadsheet, this discovery experience should be managed. Knowledge management is an undervalued discipline; if you have access to talent in this area, &lt;em&gt;use them in creating this experience&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automation-can-take-multiple-forms&quot;&gt;Automation Can Take Multiple Forms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is one portal or many, relying on “good faith” efforts aren’t scalable. Pleading for harried developers to “do the right thing” and “create some docs” doesn’t work. It, at best, results in the same stale documentation that plagues so many company content management systems. The process for data entry to the registry must be as automated as possible. Thankfully, automation is possible through standardized lifecycle management and process enforcement through uniform API descriptions, like OpenAPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to have the runtime gateway environments “phoning home” to a centralized registry. The description of the business intent would be more abstract. However, identifying highly trafficked or critical infrastructure would be a place to start building out more robust management rigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duplication-of-work-will-happen-the-degree-to-which-this-is-a-problem-is-debatable&quot;&gt;Duplication of Work Will Happen; The Degree to Which this is a Problem is Debatable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Continuous API Management (CAM) book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/api-academy-and-new-beginnings-net-api-notes-for-2019-01-31&quot;&gt;by the dearly departed API Academy&lt;/a&gt;, fingers internal API duplication on poor discovery ability. However, in my experience, &lt;em&gt;this is an oversimplification&lt;/em&gt;. Even with a comprehensive catalog of APIs, development teams may seek to minimize their dependencies. This includes other people’s APIs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;see point #2 in my talk, “Three Ways Conway’s Law Affects API Governance&lt;/a&gt;”). Internal APIs do not have the same market-force natural selection to pick winners and losers. Other sociotechnical systems engineering approaches need to be brought to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-ensure-new-apis-are-consistent-and-meet-guidelines&quot;&gt;How do you ensure new APIs are consistent and meet guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consistency-of-design-starts-with-consistency-of-language&quot;&gt;Consistency of Design Starts with Consistency of Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before consistency can happen, we have to have a clear medium of exchange. The consistency of design starts with the consistency of language. Are the words “policy”, “guidance”, and “standards” all used interchangeably? What about “resources” and “endpoints”? Are “methods”, “actions”, and “verbs” all the same thing? Or do they have different meanings? Observe the language the business uses and create consensus where there is none. This is a foundational activity before guidelines can be built. It is also ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pair-design-requirements-to-organizational-outcomes&quot;&gt;Pair Design Requirements to Organizational Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to understand the organization’s goals. Guidelines are a means of driving teams a particular direction, &lt;em&gt;but to where&lt;/em&gt;? Guidelines without a destination, that don’t drive an organization to a better place, will be ignored. Are new integrations taking too long because of incomplete (or even contradictory) affordances in the interface? If so, we now have an outcome (or perhaps even KPIs) to shape guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enforcement-is-not-an-all-or-nothing-matter&quot;&gt;Enforcement is Not an All or Nothing Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With guidelines matched to outcomes, we can start enforcement. There is a spectrum. One extreme is gatekeeping. This is where an API is not allowed into an environment (development, QA, production, etc.) without ‘approval’ by a company-sanctioned group. This group is responsible for ensuring that guidelines are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation can help here, as well. Tools like Spectral can detect &lt;em&gt;deterministic&lt;/em&gt; rules. These are cases where a team’s design attempts to submit a body as part of a GET operation. However, more subjective criteria, like whether “chAccPwChangeId” is self-descriptive and easily understood to the target audience, may still require human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gatekeeping approach is the simplest to implement and the easiest to understand, particularly in highly regulated industries (to prevent the bad outcomes from happening a sanctioned party reviews all the things). However, this approach introduces an organizational dependency on software development. It also can be discouraging, particularly for those that self-identify as highly-skilled, empowered individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819&quot;&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt;”, presents an alternative approach. Rather than mandating a gate, the intent is to create a desire for mastery across all constituents and then help them get there (this pursuit of mastery better aligns with the self-image mentioned above, and thus, is more empowering). Skewing on this this side means the emphasis goes from up-front prevention to ongoing internal evangelism and a service interaction models by a supporting API team. Successfully deploying, maintaining, and demonstrating effectiveness of this model is incredibly challenging, however. It is why, I believe, I haven’t seen it implemented nearly as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guidelines-are-a-process-not-a-stable-end-state&quot;&gt;Guidelines are a Process, Not a Stable End-State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, any guideline program needs a well-established and continuously practiced feedback mechanism. The market changes, developer maturity changes, and the organization’s goals change. So too should the guidelines change to reflect that reality. The process for continual co-evolution of the guidelines is so much more important than the given guidelines at any one specific point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-should-legacy-apis-be-treated-differently&quot;&gt;How should “legacy” APIs be treated differently?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly unlikely that any guideline or standards process is starting greenfield. Organizational leadership may be surprised by the number of interfaces, and the data exchanged through them, that already exist at the onset of a cataloging effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building a catalog, the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; priority, even above adherence to standards, is being listed. Once listed, an API governance team can begin a process of ‘eventual consistency’ to guidelines. This is where the API is discoverable but listed as out of compliance. When the team begins work on the next &lt;em&gt;breaking&lt;/em&gt; version, reconciling incompatibilities can also happen since the client will have to modify their code to accommodate the new version &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not fond of “burn the boats”, all-or-nothing transformation initiatives. Even if these “legacy” APIs are not the way we’d do them now, they are still providing business value to &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; (hence their continued existence). Cataloging, with an understood path forward, enables that quirky part of the corporate ecosystem to be studied and understood. As stewards of these complex systems, we’d do well to learn from the complex accretions that occurred. This is opposed to ignoring a company’s legacy to declare a fleeting ideological victory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Roadmap for AI Governance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While AI may be new(ish) for enterprises, the cultural transformation challenges are not. Seeing history repeat, I put high-level roadmap for business leadership and implementing developers on the change that is happening, the challenges, and what successful town planning of this new space looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d like thank Dan Caton, and the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Tential-Tuesday-DC/&quot;&gt;Tential Tuesdays&lt;/a&gt;, as being the catalyst for putting my jumbled thoughts, suspicious, and experience to words on this topic. Presenting at an event with a DJ was also a first. That’s some top-notch hospitality, right there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll also enshrine to the internet archive a heartfelt thank you to &lt;strong&gt;Vicki Boykin&lt;/strong&gt;. She is a data scientist and the author of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Normcore Tech email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Vicki was kind enough to provide a health dose of context to my more tenuous connections. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you, Vicki&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, onto the show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I am going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why this is a critical juncture for a particular type of AI, called &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;, in business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List where machine learning application creates risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present a roadmap for the ground that should be covered by a company’s AI governance program&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Briefly discuss how to get started, and who should do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Why is Matthew Reinbold talking about AI?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold and, for the past half-decade, I have helped multiple fortune 500 companies create more fair, equitable, and empowered knowledge communities. I create &lt;em&gt;software governance&lt;/em&gt; that empowers &lt;em&gt;digital transformation&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve found myself situated a unique intersection of business strategy, distributed architecture, and internal developer evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my career building developer communities of practice. I also continue to do a fair amount with APIs. In addition to blogging at my website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com&quot;&gt;https://matthewreinbold.com&lt;/a&gt;, I write an email newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/archive&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;. I curate a list of in-person events for API folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapi.events/&quot;&gt;Web API Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox&quot;&gt;wholesomely Tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/what-everyone-gets-wrong-about-change-management&quot;&gt;Between 60-80% of software transformation efforts fail&lt;/a&gt;. With my help, however, Capital One embraced an API platform concept, going from zero to 3.5 billion daily messages passed. My team and I did this while maintaining design consistency and cohesion, maximizing lifetime ROI and minimizing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating a thriving culture of APIs at Capital One, I generalized my approach for any digital modernization effort within an enterprise. As I assess upcoming challenges successfully building a data-driven culture, one in which machine learning can thrive, is a big one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Wild West Ghost Town&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Wardley is a researcher for the Leading Edge Forum. He popularized the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html&quot;&gt;Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners&lt;/a&gt;. It is a way of thinking about technology adoption within a company. Briefly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pioneers&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name implies, discover uncharted territory. Their work is precarious, and they take numerous wrong turns along the way. This is deep research, hard to explain, and harder to understand. However, this is the work that leapfrogs what is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlers&lt;/strong&gt; follow the pioneers, taking chance encounters and precipitous routes and creating repeatable, predictable certainty. They turn prototypes into products and products into profits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Town Planners&lt;/strong&gt; take what is settled and grow it. They scale communities and provide the stable launching points for the next group of pioneers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wild west of high-end research labs is giving way to the more humdrum of daily application and tedious ROI discussions. And that transition is causing some discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Inflection Point with AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime you combine immense potential, technical complexity, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; cultural discomfort, you end up with headlines like these. It is telling when my 91-year-old Grandfather’s is scared about AI destroying mankind, due to the technical nihilism in his daily reading. Whether it is Elon Musk declaring the end of humanity or the Pope discussing Clippy’s mental state, many pixels have been burned hypothesizing the wild west we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s anxiety we’re on the verge of losing control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can talk about practical, town planner solutions, I first need to ground our conversation. That means addressing the ad-driven, click-bait hysteria around AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, Skynet and Terminator-style robots are not imminent. The kind of general-purpose AI that we would recognize as “intelligent”, capable of comprehension and not just pattern matching, is still a significant way off. I highly recommend the book, shown here, by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis. In “Rebooting AI”, the authors do an excellent job pointing out where hyperbole has outstripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index&quot;&gt;h-indexes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have time for a book, Kevin Kelly posits some of the same arguments in his 2017 article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/&quot;&gt;The Myth of Superhuman AI&lt;/a&gt;”. There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/learn-the-red-flags-of-overhyped-ai-claims&quot;&gt;the IEEE’s article, ‘3 Easy Ways to Evaluate AI Claims’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/perception-social-outcome-slide.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI Has Promise In Specific Areas&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton’s Arvind Narayan also published a wonderful talk entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf&quot;&gt;How to Recognize AI Snake Oil&lt;/a&gt;”. I’ll leave exploring the entire piece as an exercise for the audience. However, I will steal his slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvind correctly identifies that AI used in the pursuit of perception and classification is getting better, and useful in a number of business contexts. Where there is trouble is when companies conflate classification with &lt;em&gt;predicting social outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning has Moved from Theory to Practice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a form of &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt; AI, one which uses statistics to find patterns in data. The reason we’re feeling the impact in the areas of perception and classification now is because of the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater ability to collect, store, and study data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased comfort utilizing and scaling cloud compute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recent breakthroughs creation and tuning of neural networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There will be Winners and Losers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need to be data-driven to compete in an increasingly fast-paced, complex market successfully. &lt;a href=&quot;http://accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-governance-support-innovation&quot;&gt;According to an Accenture global research survey&lt;/a&gt;, 85% of business leaders expect AI to open up new products, services, business models and markets, while 78% expect AI to disrupt their industry in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, companies that are first to harness and apply data to business processes will experience what is known in systems design as a “reinforcing loop”. Data will create machine learning models, which will have business outcomes that can be measured, which will produce more data, etc. The first companies that implement this loop will have compounding competitive advantages. First mover advantage, here, means sustained leads for as long as the competitive landscape remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the need may be obvious, however, fulfilling this vision is hard. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/02/companies-are-failing-in-their-efforts-to-become-data-driven&quot;&gt;According to NewVantage, seventy-seven percent of companies surveyed report problems adopting big data initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, from the same research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;72% of survey participants report that they have yet to forge a data culture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;69% report that they have not created a data-driven organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;53% state that they are not yet treating data as a business asset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52% admit that they are not competing on data and analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way: pioneers discovered a new place, the settlers demonstrated value, but most haven’t found the town planners to scale this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a data-driven culture, one that can feed machine learning, is difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; Many will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Continuous Delivery for ML is Emerging&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will attempt the transformation. However, deferring all responsibility for ‘correctness’ to practitioners will result in as many definitions of ‘correct’ as their are people in the org. Companies need to think more holistically about how they approach AI in general, and machine learning, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just managing the assets used to create a model, for example, is challenging. A successful machine learning model is &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43146&quot;&gt;As a research paper from Google points out&lt;/a&gt;, technical debt in these systems arises not from code complexity, but from data dependencies, model complexity, reproducibility, testing, monitoring, and dealing with changes in the external world. Further, a business should be able to release new models into production at any time. It may not be necessary to release all the time. However, the ability to do so means the decision becomes a business one, not a technical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have well-understood processes for the continuous delivery of code into production environments; how shops apply automation, quality, and discipline to create repeatable and predictable outcomes. However, packaging and delivering the data, code, and model simultaneously is still an emergent area. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler’s website for more on continuous delivery for machine learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a continuous delivery pipeline not just for code, but for data and models is difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; There will be a lot of failures before we have this figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regulatory and Ethical Challenges are Growing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as companies believe they understand the landscape they need to be successful in, they discover that the landscape &lt;em&gt;is changing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last several years have demonstrated an increasing societal awareness of data and its impacts. A decade ago, ethics and fairness conversations happened, but they were limited, mostly, to policy wonk circles. Thankfully, that is not the case today and these are above-the-scroll topics for discussion; &lt;em&gt;we are in a different place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States, in response, are creating legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act. Before that was the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. I’d wager we aren’t done with these yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Successfully navigating the growing regulatory regimes and changing societal moors is difficult&lt;/strong&gt;. There will be some high profile failures (and even some unintended consequences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules&quot;&gt;as we’re learning in light of the FTC COPPA fallout amount YouTube creators&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Done Badly, ML Can Destory Lives&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a machine learning model look like when it fails? Lost opportunities, unjust systems, and &lt;em&gt;destroyed lives&lt;/em&gt;. Worst case, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612775/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/&quot;&gt;described in the MIT Technology Review article,&lt;/a&gt; failed algorithmic decision making perpetuates societal ills. And it does so without clear “bad-guy” to detain and publish. Often, there is little to know accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have written about algorithmic failure, at scale.  For those interested, I’d recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automating Inequality by Virginia Eubanks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technically Wrong by Sara Wachter-Boettcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;What is a Developer to Do?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to predicting, policing, and preventing all the complex interactions, post-production, between systems machine learning practitioners might not even know about or control. Expecting engineers to be experts in all of these areas is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges with AI are not just a “techie” problem. They’re not just an “analyst” problem. The complexity of this landscape is not something any single pioneer or settler is equipped to address. These problems are a company problem that requires a much broader and more systematic approach to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Successfully Scaled System Requires a Different Approach&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital town planners are skilled at growing a complex system.  These folks take their cues from urban planning, community organizing, and systems thinking. To solve complex emergent behaviors in software, they eschew causal, command-and-control approaches in favor of dynamic, community driven efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just hire some of these town planners, right? Or, better yet, just tell the folks on hand to start thinking like this and get back to regular work, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Arto Marttinen on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI Governance?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the potential is great and the challenges well known, then what do companies struggle with this? According to that NewVangage survey I cited earlier, executives state the problem isn’t related to the technology. Rather:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ninety-three percent of respondents identify people and process issues as the obstacle. Clearly, the difficulty of cultural change has been dramatically underestimated in these leading companies — 40.3% identify lack of organization alignment and 24% cite cultural resistance as the leading factors contributing to this lack of business adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT governance is &lt;em&gt;the people, processes, and tools deployed to ensure the effective and efficient use of technology to achieve business goals&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;AI governance&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore, &lt;strong&gt;is a branch of IT governance to ensure the effective and efficient application of &lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt; to achieve business goals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective governance is more than being a bureaucratic gatekeeper, or a barrier between teams charged with delivery and the definition of done. AI governance must address the challenge of culture change. These town planners must bridge the wide world of threats and challenges with the domain expertise of the AI modeler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Start with Principles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new AI governance program doesn’t have to invent guiding principles out of thin air. The good news is that there has been a tremendous amount of well-researched, nuanced work already crafted and available for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Apple’s Security Principles require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opt-in consent for the use of people’s data for training AI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees, not contractors, to review and label samples used for ‘supervised learning’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nips.cc/&quot;&gt;the NeurIPs conference&lt;/a&gt; encourages the declaration of critical components for reproducing a result be included with any work, including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of models trained before the “best” one was selected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The computing power used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Links to code and dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/&quot;&gt;The IEEE also has a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; available describing a host of ethical considerations in autonomous and intelligent systems&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach-to-ai&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ainowinstitute.org/aap-toolkit.pdf&quot;&gt;AI Now&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) also have some great material available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;But Success is More than a Checklist&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, successful governance is more than just a checklist of things to do or not do. It must holistically address the entirety of a company’s transformational journey. These town planners shouldn’t just be sharing rules and approving forms. A community of practice can group their activity into three broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Understanding the Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI governance must understand the terrain they operate in; not only the dynamics that shape the landscapes within their own companies but industry and societal forces, as well. Success in this area requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building team amidst ambiguity, as there aren’t many maps for these territories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborating across functional boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the interplay between technology, business strategy, and ethics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying where AI has outsized impact on people’s lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;helping-teams-navigate-the-terrain&quot;&gt;Helping Teams Navigate the Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the landscape is understood, governance must help their fellow employees cross, safely and efficiently. This crossing might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introductory training across the entire company about AI’s importance to the company’s strategy, what it is, and how they can contribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gathering, like an anthropologist, the experience and best practices of people already practicing responsible AI to codify and redistribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empathetic listening to the fears and concerns at all levels, and carving the feedback channels back to those best able to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auditmeasurement&quot;&gt;Audit/Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the list of critical, impactful areas where AI is making a decision, it is then important to have regular, ongoing audit to prevent failures and test fitness. Areas include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inputs&lt;/strong&gt;, like data quality and potential bias in training data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model(s)&lt;/strong&gt;, including statistical tests for model fit (overfitting, causation versus correlation), model transparency (interpretable), and  stress testing against simulated data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outputs&lt;/strong&gt;, listing decisions with explanations, and possible outliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this area, I see a future, emergent discipline. It would be one part data scientist, but another part ethical hacker. They would be familiar enough with the science to understand where the edges of a model begin to break down; things like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06638.pdf&quot;&gt;poisoning just 0.025% of the data can have a machine learning system misclassify the target&lt;/a&gt;. This new job title would stress assumptions made by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governance has Much to Do&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are broad categories of things governance &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do. However, what might that include, &lt;em&gt;tactically&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-tensions&quot;&gt;Resolving Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AI Governance group could be called upon when two values, seemingly, conflict. An example would be in a business attempting to create a model  for personalized recommendations. Promoting tantalizing, or outright salacious, content might increase the total amount of time users engage on site. However, what if constitutes tantalizing to one group is scandalous in others? Setting the lines here requires clarity and consensus on ethical concepts, and well-understood means for the resolution of these tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/ai-ethics-must-move-beyond-lists-principles-new-report#node-5024&quot;&gt;A whitepaper from the Nuffield Foundation&lt;/a&gt; explore these challenges in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-what-constitutes-a-critical-decision&quot;&gt;Defining What Constitutes a ‘Critical Decision’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors for determining which algorithmic functions have greater risk include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of data was used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What variables were considered?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Global and/or local interpretability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-environmental-impact-targets&quot;&gt;Setting Environmental Impact Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/&quot;&gt;MIT recently published an article&lt;/a&gt; claiming that ‘training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five automobiles &lt;em&gt;over their entire lifetimes&lt;/em&gt;’; this includes even &lt;em&gt;the energy used to  manufacture the car itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a simple linear regression has slightly less performance, could it still be more desirable than an energy-intensive model generation? Who makes the call with whether melting the polar ice caps is an acceptable use of energy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2019-12-13&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08354.pdf&quot;&gt;This recent NeurIPSConf paper makes the case for energy use accounting be a standard part of AI accontability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2020-01-28&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Actionable steps for machine learning researchers should take to reduce carbon emissions include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700&quot;&gt;Quantifying current output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing cloud providers and data center locations wisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce wasted resources through effecient algorithms, good tests, and early debugging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing more effecient hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-creepy&quot;&gt;Defining Creepy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is necessary to analyze data and machine learning for impropriety. However, that’s not the only factor at play. Designing AI-driven experiences require an understanding of where people accept machine intervention, and where people perceive a line is crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in his book, “A Human’s Guide to Machine Intelligence”, author Kartik Hosanagar describes how people may fully embrace algorithms for things like automatic stock management (Betterment). However, they abhor automated systems in things like self-driving cars (Tesla). Why do we trust algorithms in some cases, but not in others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theory is that we’re happy to turn an algorithm onto a job previously performed by &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; (picking stocks) but not something performed by us (driving). While studies consistently show that algorithms may outperform humans, on average, we continue to believe that we are better than average (psychologists refer to this as the “better than average” effect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter of “what’s at stake”. People happily board planes everyday. Airplanes have been mostly algorithmically driven for some time. Yet, somehow, cars remain a bridge too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a capable technology and having that technology accepted by an audience is two different things. Having a group that can identify these issues ahead of a costly deployment, and mitigate them will be important for successful adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Transparent Collaboration over Coercion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody sets out to make an evil AI. I genuinely believe that the majority of people want to ‘do the right thing’. However, defining “right” and nudging people, as described &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/05/how-to-overcome-clinicians-resistance-to-nudges&quot;&gt;in this 2019 Havard Business Review article&lt;/a&gt;, may not be enough; an enterprise’s best efforts may be perceived as patronizing or subtly manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particular problem for AI practitioners because they possess three common traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A strong sense of purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A desire for autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A commitment to mastery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nudges, to these highly trained professionals, may be perceived as threats to their autonomy or questioning their professional mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is imperative that any AI governance nudge be accompanied by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparency of Purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co-Creation of Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constructive Framing (not just avoiding mistakes, but championing professional ideals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Leadership in this New Space&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effective AI governance, ironically, starts with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ve convinced some of you to take the next step. Or I’ve suggested issues would be best solved collaboratively in your organization, rather than ad-hoc on a team-by-team basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, getting started isn’t clear. Perhaps you feel that you’re “just a developer”. Maybe you assume that you need to be in upper management to create the kind of impact that I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive changes in how organizations create software in the preceding decade are directly the result of bottom-up initiatives. Whether extending experiences and capabilities to the phone, adopting responsiveness through agile and continuous integration, or growing resiliency and ability to scale with the cloud, developers have been instrumental in defining the future of their workplaces. Yet, when it comes to something like how to relate to each other, or how we govern this new area, we hesitate. Or worse, we declare it “not my job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in leveraging the power of machine learning in a just and fair way, and you’re not in a position to issue top-down edicts, there’s still a tremendous amount you can do. Begin &lt;strong&gt;identifying&lt;/strong&gt; those people in your organization using these tools. Begin having conversations and identifying common points of both practice and pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin down the path of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/cultivating-communities-of-practice-a-guide-to-managing-knowledge-seven-principles-for-cultivating-communities-of-practice&quot;&gt;building a community of practice&lt;/a&gt;. If one does not exist, create one. Start with a Slack channel and grow from there. Begin building the momentum to create a demonstrable case to leadership for the need. Don’t wait for someone to get hurt shooting from the hip, wild-west style. Apply the type of town planner approaches appropriate for this new place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visiting Carbon Offset Sites Prior to the Global Climate Strike</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This Friday, September 20th, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;Global #ClimateStrike&lt;/a&gt;. It is a day when millions of people will join youth activists, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future&quot;&gt;Greta Thunberg&lt;/a&gt;, in demanding immediate climate action. This worldwide event comes ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit. To find out if there is an event in your area, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;GlobalClimateStrike.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking to raise awareness is one thing. Taking concrete actions to mitigate our carbon footprint is another. Earlier this year, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/06/21/On-Travel/&quot;&gt;talked about how I was rethinking my approach to airline travel&lt;/a&gt;. After writing that piece, I signed up for three different carbon offset subscription services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offset.earth/&quot;&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projectwren.com/&quot;&gt;Project Wren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edenprojects.org/&quot;&gt;Eden Reforestation Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one is the best? After several months using each, here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impressions&quot;&gt;First Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all three, &lt;strong&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/strong&gt; has the clearest call to action with cute, cartoony graphics: &lt;em&gt;give money, save the planet&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Project Wren&lt;/strong&gt; is similar, albeit more focused on specific initiative support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eden Project&lt;/strong&gt; is a more “traditional”, non-profit website. By that, I mean it has sections for ‘Mission and Vision’ and ‘Leadership’. It, too, highlights specific projects in various geographical regions. In addition to its reforestation work, the Eden Project also emphasizes the job creation that comes from its programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-signup-process&quot;&gt;The Signup Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offset Earth has the most straightforward signup process. A new individual is presented with three monthly donations options. This “small”, “medium”, and “large” package size is extremely familiar to anyone that purchased freemium or SAAS products on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a toggle for a “family plan”, allowing some degree of customization of the recurring donation size. After selecting an option, some basic name and contact info is required to create an account. Stripe facilitates payments and the overall experience is extremely clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Wren required that I answer several questions about my lifestyle and habits. This was to calculate my carbon report. After presented with the approximate size of my carbon footprint, I was then offered the ability to sponsor one of several projects, each listing its  approximate impact, in ‘cost per ton’, toward offsetting my calculated number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/09/wren-signup.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Sample Set of Questions to Calculate a Carbon Footprint&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eden Reforestation Project has a one-page signup. There are five suggested amounts. There is also options to customize both the size of the donation and whether to make recurring or occur once. Donations can be targeted via a drop-down selector, requiring that you either pick one at random or open up a second browser tab to research each elsewhere on the site. To gauge impact, Eden focuses less on &lt;em&gt;tons of carbon&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it cites “number of trees planted” and “number of workdays created” as crucial metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ongoing-communication&quot;&gt;Ongoing Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;offset-earth&quot;&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offset Earth users have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://offset.earth/5d33754e2e740f00100f2200&quot;&gt;shareable dashboard displaying the number of days they’ve been offsetting their carbon, the amount of carbon offset, and the number of ‘trees in the forest’&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an illustration showing, month-by-month, how “big” your trees have gotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is cute and makes a good first impression. However, I don’t know if it is something that I’ll continually visit. It also is an  approximation, as I’m told my donations have gone toward wind turbines in Turkey and improved cooking stoves in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emails have been approximately once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/09/offset-earth-month2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Representation of the Saplings &quot;Planted&quot; Because of My Donations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-wren&quot;&gt;Project Wren&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Project Wren, my monthly recurring donation is used for Amazon Rainforest protection. Thankfully, the site also provides an approximation of the impact this support is having in the form of the total amount of carbon offset. If you wish to go deeper, Project Wren provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectwren.com/footprint/23467&quot;&gt;a personalized carbon report based on information given during signup, with the carbon calculator&lt;/a&gt; (my previous travel patterns profoundly stands out here). Addition actions are suggested based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an email at varying times during the month from “Ben”. It has included news related to the project I’m supporting along with additional calls for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eden-reforestation-projects&quot;&gt;Eden Reforestation Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eden Reforestation Project allows you to sign up for a monthly, recurring donation. Oddly, this does not also create an account on their site. I receive monthly email invoices letting me know my credit card has been charged. I’ve also received a monthly email letting know about their ongoing work. However, it is not personalized; for example, there’s a ‘Donate today!’ call to action addressed to someone that is already donating. The email is also from an entity, not an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the Eden Project was the only site where I was allowed to &lt;strong&gt;opt-out&lt;/strong&gt; of email updates during the signup process. While both Offset Earth and Wren have the ubiquitous “unsubscribe from this list” links in their follow-up emails, I appreciate being given the option from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is the apparent winner? The planet, of course. I can see each of these sites appealing to a different audience. Pick the one that is best for you. You don’t have to be like me, getting my kicks by diversifying my support across many simultaneous initiatives. &lt;strong&gt;But pick one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you’re so inclined, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;Global #ClimateStrike&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s turn the &lt;em&gt;climate crisis&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;climate action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/whiteboard.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Attempting to Whiteboard Productivity&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is another video collection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of “productivity suggestions” online. Often referred to as “hacks”, some genuinely are useful. Most, however, are slight rehashings of common sense or trivial alternative ways of doing a thing. A few are downright counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a handful of videos I’ve found to be genuinely useful. They require a greater investment than the hacks you might find most places. I’d go so far as to refer to them as productivity &lt;em&gt;lifestyles&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re up for a challenge, I’ve found the returns they offer are worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creativity-in-management-by-john-cleese-video-arts-1991&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creativity in Management&lt;/em&gt;, by John Cleese, Video Arts (1991)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is Monty Python’s John Cleese giving a business lecture. However, despite it being a “serious” talk, the viewer ends up getting tremendous insight into John’s creative process. I particularly like his steadfast insistence to take all available time to search a creative space exhaustively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it also turns out that John is an entertaining speaker. Whoda thunk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g&quot;&gt;John Cleese on Creativity in Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep-is-your-superpower-by-matt-walker-ted-2019&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep is Your Superpower&lt;/em&gt;, by Matt Walker, TED (2019)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pulling an all-nighter” is romanticized in software development. And there was a time where I did that to make deadlines on a fairly regular basis. However, as I grew older I began to notice that the time it took to “bounce back” became longer and longer. Comparing working me in my 20s verses a 40-year-old me after a night with a sleepless baby is &lt;strong&gt;stark&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sleep is important. Probably not a news flash there. However, the &lt;em&gt;degree&lt;/em&gt; to which it is essential shocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a search, you can find quite a few videos by Matt Walker online. However, I like this one from the 2019 TED conference. It packs all his usual witticisms into a digestible twenty-minute chunk. The difference, for me, of having six or eight hours of sleep a night is my overall stress level, ability to roll with the punches, and reciprocate social graces. The older I get, the more powerful superpower that becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM&quot;&gt;Sleep is Your Superpower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, Matt goes into greater detail (with more specific tips for getting to sleep quickly, dealing with jet lag, and more) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1yGw_hfEfk&quot;&gt;a longer Google Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-brilliant-every-single-day-by-alan-watkins-tedx-2012&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being Brilliant Every Single Day&lt;/em&gt; by Alan Watkins, TEDx (2012)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno about you, but there are those days when I feel fantastic: I can say the surprising, witty thing, I have an epiphany to a tricky problem, or I slip into and out of deep, concentrated flow like a salmon returning home. Then there are other times when achieving coherence is the brunt of the battle. Control over which version of me showed up, and why, was mostly a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the talk “Being Brilliant Every Single Day” provides numerous pointers on the various physiological factors that impact one’s sense of being. Being mindful of what our bodies are telling us in any given situation, and finding the appropriate methods of coping, can make a tremendous difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean I effortlessly saunter about the plains of enlightened nirvana? Hardly. However, I can attest that taking a moment to breathe, as shown in the video, successfully quiets the lizard brain before being creative or attempting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q06YIWCR2Js&quot;&gt;Being Brilliant Every Single Day (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_fFattg8N0&quot;&gt;Being Brilliant Every Single Day (Part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous, self-proclaimed, lifestyle gurus online. However, I keep referring to these videos because I’ve found the information to be useful. If you know of similar productivity lifestyle enhancements, not just hacks, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Agile Antipatterns</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Agile Antipatterns” was a June workshop I lead for the DC Technical Product Management Community. The purpose was, through techniques borrowed from Lego Serious Play, to take the audience through a journey discovery about their own software development challenges. It was different from the lecture style I usually do but, despite this, the quality and depth of the ensuing conversation exceeded my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This presentation is part of my goal to produce six original works in six months. For more information see &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/06/21/On-Travel/&quot;&gt;the post about my conversion of travel time to productive time in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides and script are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to agile anti-patterns. Thank you to Rob for giving me a chance to deliver this talk where we’re going to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tetris Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature Factories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Success Theater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly than just talk about those things, we’re going to discuss what to do if you happen to find yourself in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if none of that sounds appealing, we also have some Lego at our disposal. Regardless of what you were looking to do, by the end you shouldn’t leave disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More About Me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold and I am an adult fan of Lego. When I’m not tinkering on my own builds in my home office I am also the director of Capital One’s Platform Services Center of Excellence. My team and I are responsible for balancing software programmer independence and platform integration needs for API and event streaming development. Capital One has approximately 9,000 developers. At some point in their lifecycle, my team collaborates with those development teams. I also have done similar roles at other enterprise companies. In the past year I’ve also consulted with Allstate, CVS, and Google on how they can create more effective software development pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you deal with that many teams over the course of many years, you tend to see some things. Certain behaviors show up time and time again. At some point, these behaviors go from being random things and begin to be patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44245802094&quot;&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Models Convey Meaning&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating models - either rhetorically or with physical bricks- is important. Models allow us to visualize assumptions and surface unknown values. Models help create shared understanding between many individuals, supplementing language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image is from 2014, just after I was getting back into Lego during my adult years. I was trying to model the stairwell at work, to better understand how space was used. While I could have pondered things for some time, building a physical representation of a stairwell gave me a different perspective and greater appreciation for how the space was optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that one might create a model. I could ask you to draw your responses, or perform some interpretation of your current challenges. Don’t worry, I am not going to ask you to do that, but I would be willing to bet that some of you already have the hairs on the back of your neck just at the thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bricks, however, are far less intimidating. Many people have reservations about their artistic or thespian talents. But everyone can stick two or three bricks together. Lego presents a simple, approachable means to creating models: click/snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More About Lego Serious Play&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many here have heard of or participated in a Lego Serious Play activity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lego Serious Play, or LSP, is a technique that uses Lego blocks in directed exercises to build structures that metaphorically represent business models. In the 1990s, under the direction of then president and CEO, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen (grandson of the original Lego founder), Lego began looking for new techniques leadership teams could use when developing their strategies. The first version and trained facilitators began appearing in 2001. By 2010, Lego created the “community model” of sharing the technique, akin to open sourcing the ideas behind Lego Serious Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2014/10/29/TechnicalLiteracyForAll/&quot;&gt;I’ve used Lego, previously, engage kids in computer science exploration&lt;/a&gt;. However, tonight I’m using a less structured version of a Lego Serious Play experience, while still heavily leaning into the model creation for discussion and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Complex Stories Can Start with Simple Models&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell a great story with a few bricks. What you can see here are a series of advertisements that Lego has run in the past. While the models may be simple, they tell a very complex story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point with this models is not to have picture perfect recreations of their real-world counterparts. What we’re going for here is the metaphor. If there is one rule this evening, it is that people should “&lt;strong&gt;Comment on and critique the metaphor, not the construction&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to our first question for us to dig into. As technical product management, you either are working, or have worked with, a development team. I want you take a few minutes and create a model for your role in the development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;hold up a stack of bricks&lt;/em&gt;) Perhaps this is your model -a bastion of stability, solid and firm for your team to be built upon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;hold a gear&lt;/em&gt;) Or maybe this is your model - a cog in a machine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;hold up a captain minifig&lt;/em&gt;) Maybe this is how you see your role in the development process - a Captain, ready to lead the team to adventure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;remove the head from the captain minifig&lt;/em&gt;) Or maybe this is how you feel, a headless captain, given all the responsibility but none of the answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I want you to build is a metaphor for your role in the software development lifecycle. Let’s take five minutes and then we’ll discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a timer onscreen. When it reaches zero, I’ll ask a few folks to share their creations. Again, we’re not going for photo-realism and five minutes is not a whole lot of time. We need to work quickly. Go with you first idea. Trust your instincts and let’s get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready? Set. Build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(After building, five minutes of conversation where volunteers share what they’ve built, and why. We discuss the metaphors and how that makes them feel.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Introducing Planning Tetris&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get into our antipatterns. In my experience, before we can correct a phenomenon, we first have to identify and name it. Without a name, we can’t address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are the description of three agile anti-patterns. There are certainly more, but there’s only so much time that we have this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile anti-patterns typically manifest themselves as commonly applied solutions. A solution becomes an anti-pattern when it ceases to provide an effective fix, or when the cumulative effect of repeatedly applying that fix has an ongoing negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of those anti-patterns is &lt;strong&gt;Planning Tetris&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tetris&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully everyone here is familiar with the game Tetris but, in case you aren’t here’s a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The shapes of various configurations enter a player’s screen from the top, and the shape begins to descend to the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player can move the shape side to side, as well as rotate it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player’s goal is to complete horizontal lines with the provided shapes. Completed horizontal lines will disappear from the gameboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The game is over when shapes can no longer descend from the top of the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to avoid gaps in the board by cramming as much together in as tight of space as possible as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/planning-tetris.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration of Tetris Playing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with product management?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people here use story points in their planning rituals? T-shirt sizes? Time-buckets? Am I forgetting any other sizing method?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, regardless of which method used for planning, each of these assume that not all work is sized the same. There are “big” tasks and “small” rocks. When prioritizing a backlog, a common approach is to weigh the size of a task with its importance. Balancing across many, potentially competing, backlogs (like tech debt, UX updates, and business imperatives) are a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem is getting the master queue prioritized for the business. Typically, there are rules for how to do this. Putting together the ‘master list’ isn’t the problem, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part, and where people get into trouble, is assigning that work. These are two separate problems, but people begin playing Tetris (optimizing for the peak number of items “done”) rather than maximizing the flow of business values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this animation, there are several parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, the business creates the “master queue” of priorities across many competing concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, teams are assigned, with the highest priority (or ‘Priority 1’) items assigned, then ‘Priority 2’, and so on. In this case, we have a UX “shared team” that will work with Team 2 on Priority 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However, ‘Priority 2’ is a big item that requires two teams. Team 2 can’t start work without Team 1. Despite the fact that ‘Priority 1’ is the highest priority, it is shuffled so that teams 1 and 2 can start at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the UX team is encouraged to “work ahead” or “get a jump on” their work, despite being dependent on Team 2’s input.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And then executive leadership comes along with their own work-to-be-done, immediately rending the previous prioritization irrelevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Properties of Planning Tetris&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are common properties of planning Tetris? Let’s run through some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pulling “small stories” into a sprint to hit some illusory “velocity” target (even when the stories have nothing to do with a meaningful goal).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging high individual utilization rates. Optimizing for “looking busy” instead of optimizing for efficacy, outcomes, and flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big-batch quarterly/annual planning whereby some group of managers/planners attempt to “put the puzzle pieces together” and “get all of this done in the quarter” (even if priorities vary drastically).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asking functional disciplines like UX to “get ahead” of the work, in an effort to work more “efficiently”. This results in an impossible-to-navigate set of dependencies and handoffs (and a lack of information exchange).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making assumptions about the size/shape of planned work (and the flow of future work) that end up being false. For example, a team will be asked to “move on” from a promising initiative because of layers of dependent plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rapidly reshuffling/rotating teams to tackle an onslaught of projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parallelizing dependent work in the hope that a “horizontal slice” of multiple projects can be completed simultaneously (instead of treating the work as a single project).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never going back to fix things. The “debt” remains, eating into the collective psyche of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ever-increasing pressure on “the teams”. Pushing teams until they crack. Instead of fixing the gaps, management layers on more and more work until the system experiences a spectacular collapse. Teams, inevitably, have to clean up
the mess (and are blamed for not “pushing back”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Banking on that “one piece” to fall into place and save the day. Until then, making no forward progress. When the silver-bullet piece fails to appear…you find the next silver bullet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alternatives to Planning Tetris&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with planning tetris?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not decompose a unit of value into tasks, and then place the tasks on other teams’ queues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In other words, what counts is the mission: the engaging outcome you hope to generate for your customers and business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to deeply &lt;strong&gt;ingrain the idea of “pull”&lt;/strong&gt; in your organization. It is a huge mindset shift. Pull means that starting something will ALWAYS mean finishing something else. You don’t load people/teams up. You don’t “push” work on teams. Rather, you wait for teams to reach out when they’re ready, and you respect that. You have to trust your teams to do their best without asking them to pre-commit to big batches of work and “stretch goals”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop fetishizing busyness and output&lt;/strong&gt;. Place a premium on doing more with less. Make craft, thriftiness, and frugality a part of the culture. “Above and beyond” is fine, but it often inadvertently swamps the system. It also incentivizes local heroism over global flow. Focus less on output/busyness, and more on benefits and outcomes. (this can be challenging when metrics are set up in such a way to promote “business”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage work in progress/process constraints&lt;/strong&gt;. WIP constraints serve as a forcing function for continuous improvement, a catalyst for pull, and a signal that the system is straining and needs some TLC. Think of every piece/level on a Tetris board as WIP. Unfortunately, WIP constraints are counterintuitive: we look to estimates/guesses to “size up” the work and “fill up” the system. This is a recipe for dangerously high utilization rates and long, long lead times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visualize dependencies / visualize the whole. When we split things up, we tend to lose the thread. By visualizing things “as a whole”, we tend to make wiser decisions. Instead of six “projects”, we have a single mission.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do something about the “debt”. Cutting corners creates gaps. We rationalize cutting corners to learn earlier, deliver earlier, and make money earlier. The problem is that the debt add up and add psychic drag on teams and, eventually, overwhelm them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map your assumptions. We tend to act based on a web of assumptions (some conscious, some unconscious, some fragile, others robust). Building shared understanding around our assumptions can expose “tangled webs” early, and encourage us to simplify, solidify plans at the last responsible moment, and leave more slack in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Modeling You in Relation to Your Backlog&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to our models. We previously created a model of our roles in our product development. We’re going to continue to build on that. Take the model of yourself and create the relationship between you and your backlog (or backlogs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a treasure of untapped potential&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a dumpster fire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pipeline of great ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an overstuffed stuffed closet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating that model, take what we’ve learned about planning Tetris. Is there an aspect to that in your sprint grooming? Are you optimizing for a high rate of Work-in-Progress (WIP)? Do you metrics celebrate busyness or velocity? How does that manifest in your model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(After building, five minutes of conversation where volunteers share what they’ve built, and why. We discuss the metaphors and how that makes them feel.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Introducing Feature Factories&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning Tetris, if left unchecked, results in teams producing things for the sake of producing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, development has been come a factory, pumping out features, and the team are just line workers. They’ve become disconnected from the business value derived from their work. They finish a feature, or close a ticket, only to get another immediately afterward with little sense of continuity or importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2020-01-17&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/tribbles.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://charleslambdin.wordpress.com/2020/01/16/facilitation-as-wizardry-outcomes-elicitation/&quot;&gt;this image from Charles Lambdin’s post&lt;/a&gt;. It perfectly illustrates the problem of mistaking feature velocity for value generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature factories (also called feature pumps) are incredibly corrosive to morale and, despite the pressure to create an ongoing stream of work, &lt;strong&gt;decreases&lt;/strong&gt; the alignment with the missions of the company. Outputting things is more important than the outcomes those things cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Feature Factories Illustrated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we have the agile antipattern of feature factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like to work in a feature factory? &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/beat-the-feature-factory-runpre-cap-design-studios-725d1c83ecd7&quot;&gt;This quote sums up the experience&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You know… when this is “done”, we will have moved on to the next thing. Sure we will have shipped something, but it will be anyone’s guess whether this actually worked. When do we answer that question? It just never seems to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Properties of the Feature Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you tell that you might be working in a feature factory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid shuffling&lt;/strong&gt; of teams and projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of compelling missions or initiatives, teams deal in feature and project assignments. Chronic multitasking and over-utilization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrequently acknowledged failures&lt;/strong&gt; and scrapped work. No removed features. Primary measure of success is delivered features, not delivered outcomes. Work is rarely discarded in light of data and learning. Often the team lacks the prerequisite safety to admit misfires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No connection to core metrics&lt;/strong&gt;. Infrequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team cannot connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Impossible to connect iterations to “what matters most”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No PM retrospectives&lt;/strong&gt;. Product managers do not conduct regular retrospectives on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits. Developers have “passing tests”, but product managers do not. Product managers view velocity and output as their key performance indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsessing about prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;. Mismatch between prioritization rigor (deciding what gets worked on) and validation rigor (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on). Prioritization rigor is designed exclusively to temper internal agendas so that people “feel confident”. Lots of work goes into determining which ideas to work on, leaving little leeway for adjustments and improvisation based on data. Roadmaps show a list of features, not areas of focus and/or outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No tweaking&lt;/strong&gt;. Once work is “done”, the team moves immediately on to the next “project”, leaving no time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture of hand-offs&lt;/strong&gt;. Front-loaded process in place to “get ahead of the work” so that items are “ready for engineering”. Team is not directly involved in research, problem exploration, or experimentation and validation. Once work is shipped, team has little contact with support, customer success, and sales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large batches&lt;/strong&gt;. Without the mandate to experiment, features are delivered in single large batches instead of delivering incrementally. You might still work in sprints (yay, we’re “Agile”), but nothing new is reaching customers at the conclusion of each sprint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chasing upfront revenue&lt;/strong&gt;. Features are implemented to close new deals. While not inherently wrong, the economic justifications are often flimsy (at best), and fail to account for the non-linear increase in product complexity (you make the quarter, but you pay for it many times over later). Again, this reinforces the idea that features are the unit of value measurement. Product decisions lack a sound economic grounding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shiny objects&lt;/strong&gt;. Low visibility for refactoring work and debt work-down. Low visibility for overall value delivery capabilities. As mentioned, primary measure of success is new feature output. Little appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects. Little awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success theater around “shipping” with little discussion about impact&lt;/strong&gt;. You can tell a great deal about an organization by what it celebrates (more on that in a moment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Approaches to Dealing with Feature Factories&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correcting a situation in which a feature factory exists means mending the gap that has occurred between what is worked on and the value that is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrange a meeting with your company’s CFO.&lt;/strong&gt; Have them explain the moving parts in the business model, and the assumptions that underpin forecasts and growth targets. How do you really make money, and what must remain true for you to continue to make money? What costs matter now? Why are sales goals what they are? Where does product performance fit into the big picture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To defeat the feature factory, the line-workers (that’s you) must learn to speak the language of the business as well as the language of their craft. It’s the game you’re playing. Be wary when told that the team “just needs to execute”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the ‘language of business’ sound like? Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“If we continue to iterate on this existing feature we can achieve that goal without having to fork the product. It’s worth our focus.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“The work we’re doing is barely making a dent in the key metric.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“If we accumulate this technical debt, we wont be able to meet those goals for new product development.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Churn will increase beyond your threshold if we don’t double-down on nipping this expectation mismatch in the bud.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We can still meet these sales goals if we choose to be more selective. Building feature on demand is a distraction, and I’ll show you why ….”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a reframing of one’s job. It means you’re not just there to deliver work. But by speaking the language of business you can break out of the factory model by explaining how peak optimization is hurting the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Modeling the Delivery of Business Value&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrate the value of your work in terms of business output - the value created by your teams is not the number of features delivered, and be wary of any metric that only looks at features delivered, tickets closed, etc. Emphasize the outcomes created in terms of business value - what does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(After building, five minutes of conversation where volunteers share what they’ve built, and why. We discuss the metaphors and how that makes them feel.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Introduction to Success Theater&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continued production a features, now unmoored from real value creation, cause an interesting dynamic. Lots is getting done, but there’s questions about whether it is the right thing. Those that are creating the work now have a stake in selling the work as valuable. In that respect, they become complicit in marketing the work. They are performers in what is known as “success theater”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its base, “success theater” is an projected optimism and celebration of delivery that doesn’t match the reality of customer reaction. It’s that the burndown chart must go to zero, or features delivered quarter after quarter go up and to the right, although there were corners that needed to be cut. It’s vanity metrics - the ones that celebrate more for the sake of more, but have little to do with value delivered. It’s optics and smoke and spin and the more levelheaded you are about honest summaries, the more likely you’ll be cut out of the loop for not being a “team player”, or “being a critic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Properties of Success Theater&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tell-tale signs of ‘Success Theater’ include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“pervasive good news culture”, including creation of a particular language. For example, you are not allowed to point out problems, or discuss weaknesses. Instead, anything that isn’t great today is “an opportunity”. (Story about color coding an item in a spreadsheet as ‘light green’ instead of green when it is behind schedule, because coding the row as yellow would raise alarms.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every plan is a hockey stick; in order to justify the hiring and spending wanted now, significant ROI has to be shown the day after tomorrow. Or, there’s always the story that next year is the year it all comes together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messengers are shot - people who raise concerns keep disappearing - either moving on of their own accord, or have odd reasons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you do a product showcase? Warts and all? Is it scary to share anything less than the final product to product owners? Stakeholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide24.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Approaches to Dealing with Success Theater&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success Theater is the last resort of teams that have done the tetris planning, toiled in feature factory, resulting in little-to-no meaningful impact; as a resort, the team is forced to trumpet hollow talking points to justify all their activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success theater has its own language. Like combatting feature factories, it is vital to recognize the prevalent storytelling and frame the discussion accordingly. This won’t be undone easily, either. If you work in one of these places you won’t be able to walk to your manager’s office door tomorrow and be celebrated for the list of grievances you nail to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask people to highlight issues or concerns - if the culture is averse to admitting weakness, you can soft pedal by asking “if a risk were to develop, where would it be?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lead by example - find those in leadership that are passionate pragmatists, concerned about the craft more than the ladder climbing. This leadership needs to reinforce the message, swarming on the things that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share challenging news, but beware of tone - this isn’t to wallow or curry sympathy. This is an open conversation with an emphasis on learning; despite the fact there might have been a setback, use it to engage and energize people that there is a way forward.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celebrate those who share an issue or concern, reinforcing their courage and willingness to be vulnerable. It is a way you signal it’s ok to share concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you have “real” wins, celebrate them like crazy! Shout from the rooftops - put a spotlight on the things that really matter. Have avenues for telling your story and make sure the message isn’t ignored from “celebration fatigue” by only using them for the big things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promote people who have bounced back. - celebrate those who have demonstrated resilience, rather than those who have never tasted failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide25.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Celebrate Real Wins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a culture where true impact is valued is vital. How do you celebrate the ‘real’ wins? What does that look like in your company? Add to your model how you’ll overcome superficial superlatives, and elevate those things that create real positive customer impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(After building, five minutes of conversation where volunteers share what they’ve built, and why. We discuss the metaphors and how that makes them feel.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/08/Slide27.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of successfully implementing an agile development process are numerous. We’ve only just scratched the surface. However, it is my hope, that by providing an introduction to planning tetris, feature factories, and success theater you’re better able to identify these problems before they grow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Overcoming Complexity through the Principle of Least Power</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the slides and script for the presentation I made on July 17th at the San Francisco APIDays Conference. The theme for the event was ‘The New API Stack’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This presentation is part of my goal to produce six original works in six months. For more information see &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/06/21/On-Travel/&quot;&gt;the post about my conversion of travel time to productive time in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here is the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2019-08-13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video recording for the talk has been released. If you’d prefer to watch rather than read, &lt;a href=&quot;#video&quot;&gt;I’ve embedded it below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome, everyone. My name is Matthew Reinbold, and my talk this morning is how to overcome &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;principle of least power&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@shemul?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Shahadat Shemul&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/search/photos/complexity?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Defining software complexity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern software architecture &lt;em&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. John Ousterhout, in his book “A Philosophy of Software Design”, defines complexity
as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to
understand and modify the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a barrier to the kind of business agility that we crave, that is desired to win in competitive marketplaces, is how hard our architectures are to grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Complexity grows. For everyone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complexity is a problem that we all share. Clear back in the innocent, carefree days of 2011 Marc Andreessen quipped that “software was eating the world”. That same year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2011/11/30/now-everycompany-is-a-software-company/#42438fbdf3b1&quot;&gt;Forbes declared that “every company is a software company&lt;/a&gt;”. Sometime around the middle of this decade, our community began talking about how “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/apis-fuel-the-software-thats-eatingthe-world/&quot;&gt;APIs were eating software&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Director for the Capital One Center of Excellence, I lead the team that sets the API and event streaming standards for 9,000 geographically disbursed developers. A vast majority contribute to the thousands of in-production, internal APIs that our company uses to deliver new products and experiences. My team and I oversee an internal ecosystem that delivers 3.5 billion API requests a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that “day job”, I also write an email newsletter called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/netapinotes/archive&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;”. There, I love to highlight stories of how other companies are managing their API journeys. While many are at different points along the road, all of us eventually run into same problem: complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;APIs offer the greatest leverage point in a dynamic system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why APIs? Because the API is the greatest leverage point in a complex system. An API is a means of abstracting complexity and hiding it behind an interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That abstraction allows programmers to work on a system without being exposed to all a system’s complexity at once. An API is a simplified view which omits unimportant details. It makes it easier for us to think about and manipulate complex things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why APIs have exploded, both internally and externally. In our organization, we might have started with APIs - either our own or 3rd parties - for critical functionality. However, in time, patterns emerged to deal with the &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; of the environment. If you’re Netflix’s Daniel Jacobson, you call these “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danieljacobson.com/blog/306&quot;&gt;experience APIs&lt;/a&gt;” (2014). If you’re Phil Calçado, director at Meetup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://philcalcado.com/2015/09/18/the_back_end_for_front_end_pattern_bff.html&quot;&gt;this is the Backend-for-Frontend (or BFF) pattern&lt;/a&gt; (2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that this orchestration API layering was taking place, &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html&quot;&gt;James Lewis and Martin Fowler were talking about an abstraction they saw called &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Even these abstractions meant to hide complexity birth their own complexity when done in mass.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, complexity is neither creator or destroyed, is just changes shape. Not only are there more services, resulting in the infamous “microservice death star” style graphs, but the complexity introduced to try and manage these services – deployment pipelines, service meshes, monitoring tools, auditing, dependency managements also introduce their own emergent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, over the past several years, through the writing on Net API Notes, I’ve seen a number of pieces where companies retreat back to a monolith exactly because they were more comfortable with the complexity that they had known rather than the new form it had taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With enough abstractions, we begin to see that layers change at different rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images from “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/05/13/an-open-source-benchmark-suite-formicroservices-and-their-hardware-software-implications-for-cloud-edge-systems/&quot;&gt;An Open Source Benchmark Suite for Microservices&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Layering of abstractions move at different rates.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstractions changing at different rates doesn’t just happen in software. Wherever there are people, we see a stratification among abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, “The Clock of the Long Now”, Stewart Brand described “Pace Layers”. He identified layers with each layer building upon slower-moving layers beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom are those things that are the slowest to change. These are things of &lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt;. As far as we know, the laws of physics haven’t changed. For example, the speed of light is constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the &lt;strong&gt;cultural&lt;/strong&gt; layer. People are people. It’s why the stories of the Greeks and Romans still resonate with us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above that is &lt;strong&gt;governance&lt;/strong&gt;. Note that this is not &lt;em&gt;governments&lt;/em&gt; (think democracy or populism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above that, moving at a faster clip, is &lt;strong&gt;infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;. These are things like our road systems, or the electrical or plumbing networks in this building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving even faster that that is &lt;strong&gt;commerce&lt;/strong&gt; or the rate at which new products, services, and experiences can be brought to a market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the top and moving with the greatest speed, is fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fast layers innovate, slow layers stabilize.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One layer isn’t more important than another. It turns out that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; layers are important for a well-functioning system. Each has its place. Imagine if something as important as foreign policy was being run on a whim? Or if innovation was only allowed to happen at the speed of bureaucratic consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stewart says in his book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes. Slow disposes. Fast is discontinuous and slow is continuous. Fast and slow informs slow and big by accrued innovation and occasional revolution and slow and big control slow and fast by constraint and constancy. Fast gets all our attention but slow has all the power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An API Pace Layer begins with unchanging natural laws.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to web, or ‘net’, APIs I see similar stack that changes at different rates. I’ll insert my usual model disclaimer here: “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. I acknowledge this is incomplete, but this API Pace Layering model we’re about to walk through is useful for raising topics for discussion and illustrating insights about complexity (and where we attempt to hide it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom, again, are the laws of &lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt;. The speed of light sent between distributed systems is constant. Not a whole lot there likely to change soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;TCP is foundational, constant and unchanging.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next is the TCP layer. That protocol has been around since the 70s. That’s probably a good thing, as something as necessary as packet transmission needs to be stable; considering the amount of physical hardware, languages, and frameworks that have it “baked in”, you wouldn’t want it changing often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;HTTP is the next layer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we go up, remember that we’re beginning to pick up the rate of change. There are lots of protocols, like FTP or email. However, most of us in this room are probably familiar with HTTP. HTTP 1.1, which a guy named Roy Fielding worked on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;was ratified in 1999&lt;/a&gt;. HTTP/2, which many haven’t implemented yet, was approved in 2015. It’s not whipsawing speed, by any stretch of the imagination. However, compared to TCP, it’s changing faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;HTTP can be thought of as additional, addative layers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where I purposely made it interesting. HTTP, &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, is layered. There’s the verbs or methods. Everybody is familiar with “GET”, “PUT”, “POST”, and “DELETE”. Some might even use “PATCH”. There are others, like “OPTIONS” and “HEAD”, which are useful in other circumstances. There’s a couple more, but that’s mostly it; under ten items to recall that have been stable since the last millennium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;status codes&lt;/em&gt;; while, officially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status&quot;&gt;there are 50-60 status codes&lt;/a&gt; the ones we care about can be broken into three broad groups. Any 2xx responses tell me, as a client, my request succeeded. Any 4xx tells me, as a client, that I need to modify my request before doing it again. Also, 5xx tells client me that the API provider is having a very bad moment. Again, stable, consistent, and doesn’t require me to introspect the payload for the high-level gist of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last layer of the HTTP protocol worth highlighting is &lt;em&gt;headers&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status&quot;&gt;There are about a hundred of these&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them get into a fair amount of subtlety and nuance. Not all are that useful. However, this is where we get a wonderful set of tools to shape requests. The fastest request is the one you never have to make. If an API provides thoughtful clues through caching headers to a client, it is a beautiful, highly-performant, thing. Headers also where we can perform content negotiation, allowing the same API to return the JSON representation, a CVS file, a PDF, a binary image, or &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; all from the same resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;RFCs offer lots of opportunities for experimentation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above HTTP, evolving at a greater clip, are the IETF’s &lt;em&gt;Requests for Comment&lt;/em&gt;, or RFCs. There are &lt;strong&gt;thousands&lt;/strong&gt; of these notes which capture proposed ways communication on the internet might work. That’s a lot and there are new ones all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some excellent work here that can powerfully aid comprehension and intuitiveness of a design. When things go wrong, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807&quot;&gt;RFC7807 defines a common error object&lt;/a&gt;. By using a standard, clients aren’t left having to figure out where in the payload to look for information to help solve their issues. A standard might also suggest information, or representations of information, that you might not otherwise have considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8594&quot;&gt;RFC 8594, the sunset HTTP header&lt;/a&gt;. It is a way of telling someone that requests a URI that it may become unresponsive in the future. This one was fun to watch being born, on Twitter and through email, by this extended community. A common need for better lifecycle management was identified folks online and they swarmed together to discuss merits of different approaches. From their efforts, we now have a abstraction: the complexity of having to come up with how to do this was handled by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Patterns are numerous, and quick to evolve.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the top of this layering, are patterns. There are some patterns, like the backend-for-frontend or experience API pattern, that become popular - possibly even so popular that they end up generating dedicated RFCs to support them. Remote Procedure Call (or RPC) is a pattern. Webhooks are a pattern. Hypermedia is also a pattern. These can are multitudinous, and a new one can be introduced as quickly as the Netflix engineering or Hacker News forums publish a new post. These are constantly changing. Some become quite fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A layered architectural approach gracefully degrades.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing about how these layers perform in a complex system is how they gracefully degrade. Suppose, for example, that I provide an API that implements an RFC, like the common error object. What if the client isn’t expecting, or doesn’t care that I’m following a prescribed standard. Do we fail to exchange meaningful information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course not&lt;/em&gt;. A client unaware of RFC 7807 would only see a JSON response returned to them, and they would parse it anyway, the same as they would if my response was something that I came up with off the top of my head. The advantage are those complex ecosystems featured in the microservice death stars – when all services express information in the same way, it opens opportunities for tooling; tooling which takes the cognitive burden from developers, freeing them to focus on the business problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take another example and go a layer deeper. As an API provider, I have the best understanding of when the underlying data changes. As a result, I provide cachecontrol and ETag headers to the client, allowing them to make smart decisions about when to request an object. After all, the fastest API call is the one that didn’t have to happen in the first place. If a client is savvy and picks up on it, great! If not, &lt;strong&gt;things still work&lt;/strong&gt;; maybe not as efficiently, maybe not as elegantly. However, building in layers that can gracefully degrade means that communication is still possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;GraphQL cuts across layers, connecting an interaction pattern to TCP.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for a brief moment, let’s talk about GraphQL (going through a similar exercise for gRPC is left to the reader). GraphQL is a query language for data retrieval and updating via HTTP. I put it in the “pattern” layer, as it is a different API interaction pattern between client and server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other patterns that I had previously mentioned, however, GraphQL is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; built upon the same layered approach. All requests, be it data retrieval or mutations to update, are submitted via POST. The only status code ever returned is a 200, requiring introspection of the payload &lt;em&gt;of every response&lt;/em&gt; in case there is an error embedded in it. Headers aren’t encouraged, as they’re not displayed in tooling like the explorer from GraphQLHub.com. There’s no equivalent RFC-like error response for GraphQL, although vendors like Apollo are promoting their approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a paradox here. I can hear it. “Matthew,” you might say, “by freeing us from having to think about verbs or codes or headers or RFCs – by getting rid of the layers, aren’t we abstracting complexity behind a single abstraction?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;complexity is neither creator or destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;, is just changes shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is not a layered approach; everything from the pattern to the TCP/IP layer is either strictly specified by GraphQL or left for developers to recreate in their own, bespoke way. Eschewing layers, as GraphQL gives developers tremendous power to solve problems exactly how they imagine a problem to be solved; both from the consumer’s point of view, where they can tailor the response to their needs. The API provider also can implement their own approaches to common distributed systems problems. But that power comes with &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. The layers that abstracted the complexity of things like caching, of error handling, content negotiation are all left to the developer. And having each GraphQL solve those things in their own fashion will increase the complexity of comprehension on the part of clients and tool makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To combat complexity, the principle of least power suggests keeping things simple and within layers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html&quot;&gt;The principle, or rule, of least power states that one should&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seems incredibly counter-intuitive. Don’t we want &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; power to solve problems? Shouldn’t we deserve the newest tools? The most flexible frameworks? Who in their right mind is a fan of the least among us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can apply this to our layers. When I call an API, I can include instructions as to whether I’m reading or updating information in the payload; that is a payload the server will have to introspect and act on. Or I can use the humble verb at the lowest layer, and signal the same thing via a GET or PATCH. It seems like a simple thing but it drastically affects where the complexity of our tracing, monitoring, entitling, securing, rate-limiting, framework-ing, and supporting goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: 2019-09-03&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a robust list of useful, defined elements that apply to a number of common use cases, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://standards.rest/&quot;&gt;Standards.REST&lt;/a&gt;. Why re-invent the wheel?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ultimately, there is nothing wrong with fasion. Just make choice based on principle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do I hate GraphQL? Am I advocating that we should only use “boring” technology? That the old stuff is better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://boringtechnology.club&quot;&gt;The Boring Technology Club&lt;/a&gt;, that is not the message. I’ve grown to appreciate what happens within the fashionable layers. The chaotic experimentation is exciting. The vigor for overturning assumptions and pursuing new avenues is how we discover new, potentially powerful ideas. In a healthy stack, the best ideas go from being fashionable, to products sold via commerce, to essential pieces of infrastructure eventually requiring governance and important pieces of business culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do advocate for, however, is conscious, decision being made when pursuing new patterns. Eschewing layers comes with trade-offs. Enter into those decisions with eyes wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mythical Man Month author Fred Brooks said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There are no silver bullets.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An innocuous conclusion slide.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, every company is a software company which means every company is wrestling with growing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to dealing with complexity to create abstractions. The abstractions at the different layers in any system evolve at different rates, which is a good thing. Fast layers accrue innovation and occasionally incite a revolution while the slow provide stability and filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net APIs have evolved into different layers. Each layer provides a host of solutions to common problems that gracefully degrade if not used. The principle of least power suggests choosing simple, layered solutions to layer-spanning solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by making more informed decisions, fully aware of the trade-offs at hand, will those responsible for API governance be able to overcome the complexity of our current API stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/07/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Thank you for your attention.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have the slides, along with some additional color and links to sources, at my website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com&quot;&gt;matthewreinbold.com&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll announce when its ready on my Twitter stream and in my newsletter, ‘Net API Notes’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox&quot;&gt;Twitter’s @libel_vox&lt;/a&gt;, and you can follow me and continue the conversation there. Thank you for the precious gift of your attention. Enjoy the rest of the conference!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Travel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, I’ve been rethinking my approach to physical travel - particularly for conferences. Don’t get me wrong; there are few things in life more thrilling for me &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2014/05/20/magiccircle/&quot;&gt;than discovering a magic circle&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when reconnecting with online friends. However, the unrecoverable time there and back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/05/why-some-climate-scientists-are-saying-no-flying&quot;&gt;the carbon footprint accrued&lt;/a&gt;, and the time away from my family looms ever larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gretathunberg/status/1119308213722275840?lang=en&quot;&gt;To paraphrase climate activist Greta Thunberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What we need are role models who practice what they preach and live within sustainable planetary norms. Otherwise we just normalize the high carbon lifestyles of jet-setting ‘thinkfluencers’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/06/plane.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;High above the clouds the problems all look so small.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, I emphatically recognize that choice for me to change my behavior is a privileged decision. For new professionals, the networking opportunities created by regular travel may be exactly what is needed to propel them forward. Others may not enjoy their company’s support and encouragement to attend events, thus making the rare opportunities that much more precious. I get it and hold no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a lot out of attending conferences. Just &lt;em&gt;stopping&lt;/em&gt; means replacing those imagination catalysts and peer feedback loops with something else. Here’s what I’m trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Expose your mental models to the open air… Get your model out there where it can be shot at. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible.” - Donella Meadows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-local-communities-of-practice&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Building Local Communities of Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If running &lt;a href=&quot;https://netapi.events&quot;&gt;NetAPI.events&lt;/a&gt;, a list of worldwide, in-person API events has taught me anything, it’s that there’s always lots of local meetups and gatherings happening every week for most metropolitan areas. In the past, these events were something I would drop-by if there was nothing else going on (an increasingly rare occurrence these days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m making local events like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/&quot;&gt;DC Web API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Technical-Product-Management-Community-of-Greater-DC&quot;&gt;Technical Product Manager&lt;/a&gt; meetups more of a priority. There’s also a host of other noteworthy things happening just up and down the I-95 corridor. Often these events are free, have interesting things to say, and need the participating from folks like you and me to make them successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reapplying-travel-time-to-connecting-with-new-audiences&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;Reapplying Travel Time to Connecting with New Audiences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of participating, the time I put into a user group presentation is about the same as the preparation I do for a conference talk. And yet, as has happened in the past, that investment has little return beyond a single delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to be more diligent about blogging talks in detail (like about ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2018/10/31/Gardeners-Approach/&quot;&gt;Growing Software Culture&lt;/a&gt;’, ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/10/03/API-Governance-Blueprint/&quot;&gt;API Governance&lt;/a&gt;’, or ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;noodling on Conway’s Law&lt;/a&gt;’). However, this is a golden age of web-enabled audio and video. I want to put out more mixed media for those that don’t cherish chunks of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rather than create a single deck for the year and try and reuse it at a handful of events, what I’d instead do is use the time saved not traveling and create &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; conversation starters. For 2019, I have a goal to create &lt;strong&gt;six &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; presentations in six months&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus far I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May - ‘Getting Started with API Governance’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June - ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/08/02/AgileAntipatterns/&quot;&gt;Planning Tetris, Feature Factories, and Success Theater - Agile Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them’ (illustrated using techniques taken from the Lego Serious Play method&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;July - ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/07/17/OvercomingComplexity/&quot;&gt;Overcoming Complexity through the Principle of Least Power&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August - Successful Storytelling with Executive Leadership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;October - Internal ‘Back to API Basics’ Roadshow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;October - ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/11/25/ARoadMapForAIGovernance/&quot;&gt;A Roadmap for AI Governance&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(I’ll add links to the presentations as I get them posted online) *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there are all sorts of online outlets that I could be writing for. I wrestle with this. I am a big believer in not only owning one’s words, but publishing them on one’s own site. There are lots of places happy to abscond with one’s thought juice in exchange for “exposure”. However, there are still good people out there who, through hard work and passion to craft, have attracted audiences where I would feel at home. It is a matter of finding the right outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;salon-cohort&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;Salon Cohort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annmarie-thomas.com/&quot;&gt;AnnMarie Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. She is a STEM educator and author of the Making Makers. For the past several years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://annmariethomas.typepad.com/annmarie-thomas/2016/06/salon.html&quot;&gt;she has curated a monthly “Play Date” across time zones called the “Salon”&lt;/a&gt;. It is a way, using video conferencing technology, of regularly connecting exciting people for lively conversation, regardless of where they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hoped to emulate the pattern and approached several folks to do something similar for the latter half of 2019. However, my initial call ran into issues; a number of people (justifiably) were unavailable, confused by my pitch, or didn’t respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s still an opportunity to create a regular online hangout that folks look forward to with the same enthusiasm and joy as they do meeting in physical space. Given everything else going on, I’ll rethink on how better to present this and try again in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-i-do-have-to-travel&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;offset&quot;&gt;When I do Have to Travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’m quick to point out, the point isn’t a draconian ban on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; travel; it’s to make smarter decisions when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. And sometimes there isn’t a choice, like when I am required to travel for work-related reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those cases, there are sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new&quot;&gt;the carbon footprint calculator&lt;/a&gt;. It helps visualize the impact of air travel. More importantly, it provides options to support numerous programs for offsetting the impact of those trips. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-HCMbTDWVo&quot;&gt;I don’t have the carbon footprint of Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. However, every little bit helps and, when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; travel in the future I will be sure to contribute to activities that mitigate the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: 2019-08-05&lt;/em&gt;
To date, I have set up monthly, recurring donations to each of the following organizations to offset my travel footprint (and then some):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projectwren.com/&quot;&gt;Project Wren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offset.earth/&quot;&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edenprojects.org/&quot;&gt;Eden Reforestation Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Sturgeon and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://phil.bike/trees/&quot;&gt;campaign to raise awareness for carbon offsets by cycling across Europe&lt;/a&gt; remains an inspriation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;wrapup&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last several years (or the last decade, tbh) have been a strange time, filled with all sorts of grim portends. However, I think its important to remember the power of our agency among the uncertainty. No one person is going to solve everything. However, people feeling empowered to make purposeful, informed actions can be aggregated into profound change. We are not bound to the status quo until a change is forced on us; this is precisely the time to be running millions of little experiments, all incrementing toward something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you trying something different? Got something that isn’t on the list? I’d love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>APIs and Digital Transformation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/05/digital-midi-controller.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&quot;Digital Midi Controller&quot;, Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/jUwvjOmCTWc&quot;&gt;Luca Bravo on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Bill Doerrfeld interviewed me for a piece that appeared on the Adobe CMO blog entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2019/5/13/entering-the-platform-economy-why-apis-and-integrations-are-crucial.html&quot;&gt;The Platform Economy: Why APIs And Integrations Are Crucial&lt;/a&gt;”. As usual, I ended up preparing &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than what eneded up on the final piece. An sampling of my expanded responses is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Net API Notes email newsletter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/api-academy-and-new-beginnings-net-api-notes-for-2019-01-31&quot;&gt;I talked about the changing API space&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Hopefully that, as well as the answers below, provide some clarity for executive leadership on how the landscape is evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-current-state-of-the-api-economy&quot;&gt;What the current state of the API economy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API economy, however it is defined, is in a state of transition. For the last several years companies have limited, or even shuttered, their “open” developer in favor of explicit partner-to-partner relationships. From, most recently, Lyft, to Venmo, Facebook, and Twitter, companies that aren’t perusing an explicit platform strategy have significantly changed how they think about the strategic potential for APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of factors have driven this. On the one hand, I see an end to companies who released public APIs with a “build it, and they will come” philosophy. Without a vision of how corralling 3rd party developers would bolster a company’s strategic execution, these developer portals were cost centers primed for elimination as soon as the platform fervor passed. (For some comprehensive thinking on the role of software platforms, I’ve been enjoying “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Platform-Ecosystems-Aligning-Architecture-Governance/dp/0124080669/ref=sr_1_3&quot;&gt;Platform Ecosystems: Aligning Architecture, Governance, and Strategy&lt;/a&gt;” by Amrit Tiwana.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I see companies increasingly aware of their expanded risk profile due to public API access. Even with robust security, and the API is behaving as intended, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/rest-api-notes-for-2018-04-11&quot;&gt;the Cambridge-Analytica scandal awakened many&lt;/a&gt;. We now see how the seemingly benign exchange and aggregation of information can have huge ramifications. Simply “putting something out there” not only can be expensive, but it has consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that’s a footnote in the larger story. The more significant economic impact of APIs is how companies are using them to achieve greater marketplace agility. It’s the internal decomposition - the reduction coupling and coordination overhead - where the real digital transformation lies. The economic benefit from Netflix’s API approach is not from the developer program (something they ended in 2014). Highly modular architecture allows experiences, powered by APIs, everywhere on everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-have-apis-historically-disrupted-digital-business-how-will-platform-platform-integrations-continue-to-evolve&quot;&gt;How have APIs historically disrupted digital business? How will platform-platform integrations continue to evolve?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs have had, and will continue to have, an out-sized effect on reshaping the cultures of the companies that truly adopt them. Whether it is adoption of the “infrastructure as code” and CI/CD pipelines necessary to efficiently deploy them, or the rearrangement of teams to support bounded context modularity (the “reverse Conway maneuver”), APIs challenge existing organizational and operational structures. (For more information exploring the cultural implecations of APIs, please see the writeup of my conference talk, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2018/10/31/Gardeners-Approach/&quot;&gt;A Gardner’s Approach to Growing an API Culture&lt;/a&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ll see is a continued diversification of useful interactions patterns beyond HTTP’s traditional request/response model. The need for real-time workflows will necessitate investment in, and understanding of things like webhooks (also referred to as callbacks or subscriptions), websockets, and more. The interest in machine learning, along with a greater emphasis on storing and leveraging data, will necessitate more ‘algorithms-as-a-service’ APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-apis-be-used-in-b2b-partner-strategies&quot;&gt;How can APIs be used in B2B partner strategies?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More businesses realize the impact data, not only theirs but others, can have on their operations. The responsible exchange of this data is critical. APIs make organizing and managing these partnerships more easily possible due to the wide variety of proven technologies. Everything “speaks” HTTP, securing and monitoring API gateways have vetted playbooks and standards (like OAuth), and there’s a mature talent pool available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-major-takeaways-for-cmos--ctos&quot;&gt;What are the major takeaways for CMOs &amp;amp; CTOs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical leadership is experiencing pressure from all directions. To one side, they are expected to deliver impactful digital transformation to compete in the future marketplace. Simultaneously, they have to meet new (and growing) data governance expectations. APIs, with their standardization of message exchange and centralized points of control, can play an essential role in both objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Plan for Continuous Learning and Win Sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/05/open-notebook.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&quot;Laptop and notepad&quot; by Nick Morrison on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/FHnnjk1Yj7Y&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most at Capital One, my team is currently busy with &lt;em&gt;talent management&lt;/em&gt; activities. Rather than being a backward-looking review of work previous done, talent management is forward looking. When done correctly, it produces honest conversations about each’s professional ambitions. Those ambitions, subsequently, are then &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2014/01/23/SystemsNotGoals/&quot;&gt;deconstructed into the repeatable systems necessary to produce accumulating wins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant component of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; talent management plan is &lt;strong&gt;continuous learning&lt;/strong&gt;. That learning could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online coursework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grokking Books&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professional Organization Participation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimenting with new technologies and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no shortage of resources, what is in short supply is time to make it happen. A challenge, for all too many managers, is supporting ongoing learning goals not just in lip service, but with meaningful scheduling. It’s great to say you’re investing in team development. It is another thing to foist the raised expectations on an employee’s outside-of-work time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I instituted a new, dedicated “continuous learning’ plan with my team. Every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Friday is reserved for team members to focus on their learning objectives. (I created two cohorts, each of which is staggered with each other’s Fridays so that there’s still a subset engaged with our stakeholder communities.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members track their progress via a card in our Trello system stating how their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contributes to the company’s mission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progresses them toward their talent management objective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will be shared with a larger group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Win sharing” is a critical component of continuous learning&lt;/strong&gt;. Once a month, the team will get together to discuss what worked and what didn’t. I expect there to be surprises. There will be those pursuits that don’t pan out as expected. However, it remains a “win” if the team member not only discovers that new insight but shares it for the benefit of the larger group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all busy. I anticipate the biggest criticism of this proposal is whether the Center of Excellence can take 10% of our time and devote it to something other than processing team submissions for review. In my perspective, however, I don’t know how we can afford &lt;em&gt;not to&lt;/em&gt;. Technology moves fast. Things that were prudent even only a year ago may be persnickety today. One of the core pillars of the CoE activity is to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/10/03/API-Governance-Blueprint/&quot;&gt;define healthy ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Understanding the technology landscape to guide others across it requires a continuous investment in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a tax on our time, I view this as a calculated investment our talent growth, relevance, and retention. In setting this continuous learning plan, we’ve also created a forcing function. We create the habit by reserving the space and observing the ritual. If that means we need to be more efficient in our other work to meet current expectations, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is subject to change. We may try this for a few months and, with some initial learning, reformat our whole approach. Much like the individual experiments, using the experience to inform refinement our approach is a win. The only way we lose is if we never bother to try.&lt;/p&gt;
