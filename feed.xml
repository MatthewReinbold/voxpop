                <title>Thank You, Tim</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up on a farm, I learned just how stressful harvest time is at an early age. There is a very narrow window during which it is possible to maximize your returns. Go too early, and you risk spoilage. Wait until too late, and you end up leaving money in the field. And that all depends on whether the weather holds. Mistime any of those things, and you have to wait until next spring (and another six-figure seed bill) for another chance to make things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, I can recall multiple times when my Dad and other farmers in our small town (population of 440) would drop whatever they were doing to help someone in need. Sometimes it would be broken equipment (sunflowers have a nasty habit of setting themselves and the combine that is harvesting them on fire). Other times it would be a medical emergency. Regardless of the context, the community would ensure that the crop made it in because that’s what being a good neighbor was about. It is about the decency and dignity we owe each other, freely given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating college, my family and I have lived in several places. However, it was when we moved back to Minnesota that I felt that familiar sense of shared responsibility. People throw around abstract terms, like “community”, because they sound good. But I’m increasingly convinced few have first-hand, &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; experiences with what it means to be a good neighbor, or participate, sometimes at your own peril, in &lt;strong&gt;mutual aid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Governor Tim Walz was thrust into the national spotlight, I was delighted he used his platform to share and celebrate the Minnesota brand of neighborly the upper Midwest and Great Plains practice. The results of the U.S. Presidential election turned out differently than I had hoped. I’ll be processing that for some time to come. However, providing hope is always worthwhile, and I felt moved to thank Governor Walz for representing Minnesota as he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of the letter that I dropped in the mail today is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Governor Walz,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine the past several months have been a whirlwind, and I hope you’re finding moments to recover. Before the moment passes, I wanted to take a moment to thank you—not only for making Minnesota a place my family is proud to call home but also for running a presidential campaign with Kamala Harris that inspired hope, appealed to our better natures, and, above all, &lt;strong&gt;embraced joy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the short amount of time America had to get to know you, you became known as the ambassador for &lt;em&gt;Minnesota nice&lt;/em&gt;, an alternative example of &lt;em&gt;modern masculinity&lt;/em&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;America’s Dad&lt;/em&gt;. As a father of four, I’m exhausted just contemplating that last one. But you energetically took all that on, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I both grew up in South Dakota and spent two decades living across the country—Salt Lake City, Denver, and Washington, D.C. When the pandemic gave us the chance to relocate, we carefully weighed our options and ultimately chose to call Woodbury home. It was a big change, filled with the usual uncertainties. However, Minnesota has wildly exceeded our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebration and preservation of natural beauty, strong support for public schools, and a shared commitment to treating others with &lt;strong&gt;decency&lt;/strong&gt;—no matter their gender, creed, or circumstances—are core values that you and other leaders have turned into policy. Among a statewide commitment to being &lt;em&gt;good neighbors&lt;/em&gt;, we have thrived. Thank you for being such a vital part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent election results were disappointing in many ways. I worry about what the future holds for our allies abroad and our already imperfect institutions at home. Still, as my wife said this weekend, “At least Tim is still our governor.” That’s no small sliver of a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you continued success and hope you and your family find peace and rest in the months ahead. Thank you for representing the very best of what Minnesota has to offer—and for inspiring us all to be better neighbors and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Reinbold&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Surviving the Turbo Encabulator</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an honor to be asked back to speak at DevOps Days. Two years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2022/06/28/SevenSkillsToSaveSoftware&quot;&gt;I covered seven soft skills for making software change happen&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, during the heights of generative AI hype, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2023/06/23/SeparatingAIFactFromFiction&quot;&gt;I did a deep dive showing practical ways generative AI could assist API development&lt;/a&gt;. This year, maybe more than any previous year, I have to wade through propaganda, misinformation, and outright lies - and I’m not talking about the election!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than any other industry, software is drowning in bold &lt;strong&gt;claims&lt;/strong&gt;, wild speculation, and outright exaggeration. These muddied messages about what is and is not effective impact our ability to do our best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say &lt;strong&gt;claim&lt;/strong&gt;, I refer to a statement or assertion that promises specific benefits, capabilities, or outcomes. These claims are typically used to generate excitement, attract investment, or even sow confusion. They range from a modest list of apparent facts to grandiose statements about revolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I’ll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce you to the claims made by the Turbo Encabulator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain why this 80-year-old engineering in-joke is more relevant to our age than ever before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use examples from it and other sources to illustrate the techniques and outline how we might better evaluate the claims that come our way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the Turbo Encabulator relevance to our work today, we first need a bit of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1944, a British engineering grad student named John Hellins Quick wrote an article for the Institute of Electrical Engineers, Students Quarterly Journal. His studies inspired the satirical description of a revolutionary technology comprised of long strings of meaningless jargon. It went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-bovoid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the “up” end of the grammeters-“
— &lt;em&gt;John Hellins Quick, 2nd paragraph of “The turbo-encabulator in industry”, Students’ Quarterly Journal, Vol. 15, Iss. 58, p. 22 (December 1944)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went on like this for several additional paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War II brought rapid advancements in electronics, computing, and telecommunications. Post-war Great Britain was not the only country transformed (and, ultimately, having to adapt) to increase technology sophistication. In the United States, industries were just as impacted. And, like Great Britain, those in the United States challenged to comprehend technobabble and jargon found the Turbo Encabulator just as funny. Or at least some did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 1946, Time magazine published excerpts from the article under the title, “For Nofer Trunnions”. Reader feedback was mixed. One letter said, “&lt;strong&gt;My husband says it sounds like a new motor; I say it sounds like a dictionary that has been struck by lightning.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1962, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_encabulator#/media/File:GE_Turboencabulator_pg_1.jpg&quot;&gt;General Electric even published a data specification sheet for the machine&lt;/a&gt;, including a plausible-looking write-up amidst its other hundreds of offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator might have been a curious footnote in the annuals of engineering history (or at least an even more obscure one) if not for an instructional film actor named Bud Haggart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haggart became a minor celebrity in the Detroit area for appearing in several automotive information and instruction videos. One of his regular gigs was doing how-tos for GMC mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Haggart convinced the director and the crew to stay after the recording of a GMC Trucks training film. He wanted to record his version of the Turbo Encabulator. The “script”  Haggart ad-libbed in one take was based on the original John Hellings Quick article. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag&quot;&gt;That original recording can be found on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It amazed the crew, who you can hear laughing at the end of the piece. They asked Haggart how he could read the script with such a straight face. Haggart replied that “It sounds like everything else you have me read.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haggart was asked to reprise the role several times in subsequent years, each time with increased production value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1988 - A few years later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXW0bx_Ooq4&quot;&gt;Chrysler brought Haggart in to film a new version of his Turbo Encabulator, but this time, the script was changed to imply that the company had made the device&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1988 - Not wanting to be left out, Rockwell International, an American automotive manufacturing conglomerate (among other things) asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fjcJp_Nwvk&quot;&gt;Haggart to pitch a “Rockwell Turbo Encabulator”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1996/1997 - Haggart (and slapstick assistant) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRllRWfLJE&quot;&gt;deliver a version of the Turbo Encabulator for Dodge Division’s Viper Automotive Master Tech Tip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of these skits, preserved on YouTube and propagated across the internet via social media, chats, and forums ultimately inspired imitators, a brief sampling of which is below. Once you watch a few of these and trigger the algorithm to show you related videos, you quickly realize there’s an entire “Encabulator Cinematic Universe,” or ECU, for nearly every industry, interest, and profession - a brief sampling is listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1997 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w&quot;&gt;Rockwell Automation released a version of the “Retro Encabulator”, featuring Mike Kraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2013 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwmdf5m9khg&quot;&gt;SciShow featuring Hank Green on “The Retro-Proto-Turbo-Encabulator”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2016 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ILnWpi8XY&quot;&gt;Path video discussing the Micro Encabulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2018 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LOF7KM7UhY&quot;&gt;The Macquarie Telcom SD-WAN Turbo Cloud Encablulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2021 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fltOyddlnOE&quot;&gt;The Electro Turbo Encabulator with multiple electronic YouTubers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2022 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nKk_-Lvhzo&quot;&gt;SANS ICS HyperEncabulator (featuring Mike Kraft reprising his role)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2023 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk8_RWO-oIA&quot;&gt;The crazy legal issues of the turbo encabulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator has found purchase in areas as diverse as photo gear vlogs and science education curricula because technology has infused so many aspects of our modern, everyday lives. As the need for change incentivizes products to move from rigid atoms to malleable bits, we find ourselves constantly confronted with the kind of technobabble and jargon that sounds straight out of one of the many Turbo Encabulator homages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the pace of change hasn’t sped up over the last century, &lt;strong&gt;not really&lt;/strong&gt;. However, what has changed is the amount of information exposure we undergo daily, and with that exposure comes an incredible number of claims. Blogs, websites, social networks, podcasts, tutorials, videos - in an era of sophisticated “content marketing”, the amount of potential information you have access to far exceeds the amount of time you have available to consume it. And on the internet, anyone can make claims - right, wrong, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is a chart showing that the number of hours uploaded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/&quot;&gt;YouTube every minute exceeded &lt;strong&gt;500 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This equates to &lt;em&gt;approximately 30,000 hours of newly uploaded content per hour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right is a chart showing the growth of posts made to Reddit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/reddit-users&quot;&gt;In 2023, an estimated 469 million posts were published on Reddit, an 11.14% year-over-year increase.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide10-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everybody making all those claims, it becomes more challenging to be heard. As a result, those with something to say must resort to increasingly Turbo Encabulator-like approaches to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why so much of what you might hear about today’s technologies sounds like an excerpt from the Turbo Encabultor script. You’d be forgiven for thinking these real claims, things I’ve seen in the past week, is jibberish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While handling APIs using AGI is not feasible at this time, employing an ANI approach can lead to very powerful M2M APIs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem is fundamentally anchored in the decentralized consensus mechanism inherent to blockchain technology, specifically leveraging the immutability of distributed ledgers to authenticate and tokenize unique digital assets. NFTs exist as cryptographically secured, ERC-721 or ERC-1155 smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, although cross-chain interoperability with other Layer-1 protocols like Binance Smart Chain and Solana is increasingly prevalent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Private AI x CPaas offer on-premise LLM deployment for organizations to ensure data privacy and security while leveraging the power of modern LLMs and Generative AI through platforms like Ollama. This solution would include on-premise (or collocated) deployment, customizable AI models tailored to organizational needs, robust security measures, easy integration with existing systems, and continuous deployment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide10-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, ridiculous, over-the-top claims have become LinkedIn “influencer’s” stock-and-trade. Good for them. Confusing for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we would have the time, energy, and inclination to develop firsthand experience with these various technologies. However, applying that rigor to compare and contrast what is said against our hard-won knowledge doesn’t scale to the number of claims we’re faced with. This is especially true as our careers grow and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether moving into higher management roles or becoming deeply specialized individual contributors, the reality is that we are no longer hands-on with every tool and innovation shaping online discourse. This occurs as we are tasked with guiding our teams and making strategic decisions about these approaches - approaches we may have only a surface-level understanding of if any at all. This disconnect poses one of the most significant challenges aging software professionals face—how to effectively evaluate and make informed decisions about technologies they no longer have the time or capacity to master firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach would become cynical: when confronted by the overwhelming number of claims, adopt a mindset that there is nothing new and that whatever the first technology we professionally mastered is the peak of practice - everything else is just unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that some of these recent “Make X Great Again” efforts aren’t without good reasons. However, if you read enough of the justifications, you’ll get a whiff of sour grapes, the hint of “everything was better in the old days”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts that come to mind include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trunk Based Development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanilla JavaScript/No-React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloud Repatriation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving back to Monolithic architectures after trying Microservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sympathize. Nobody wants to invest their energies into something that becomes the next Google Wave or Microsoft Silverlight. The cynical approach is also straightforward to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the danger of adopting a cynical outlook and rejecting all claims outright is that it risks missing profound and industry-altering changes - and while that doesn’t happen as often as some might claim, &lt;em&gt;it does happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating Turbo Encabulator-like technobabble in claims, our old frames of reference might not always apply. What was once true in the past may not hold true in a different software paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flimflam is not new. But the democratization of the internet means there are more claims than ever, with those with something to say working harder than ever to get their message heard above the crowd. That saturation necessitates that we, those of us in all manner of tech leadership, become more active as consumers - not passive conduits for the vendor, analyst, and consultant messages, but people making informed judgments of what we do see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating new claims becomes an exercise in discerning meaningful innovation from marketing-driven hype—a skill that must be honed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating a convoluted claim, the first step is approaching with a healthy dose of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should point out that skepticism is not the same as cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy skepticism involves questioning and critically assessing claims, seeking evidence and reasoning before accepting them. Skeptics remain open-minded and willing to change their views if presented with compelling evidence. This approach helps evaluate technology claims objectively, without being swayed by hype or marketing, while still considering potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, cynicism tends to dismiss claims outright, often assuming that they are exaggerated or false without engaging in critical evaluation. Cynics generally expect deception or failure, and their approach is more closed off, making it harder for them to acknowledge the value of genuinely promising technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, skepticism is about informed doubt and a willingness to engage critically, while cynicism is about premature dismissal and a more negative, closed mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all sources are the same, and some warrant a higher degree of skepticism than others. We know (or should know) that the claim that gets the most shares or comments is not equivalent to something with the highest quality. Likewise, something published on InfoQ may be taken on more face value than whatever is at the top of HackerNews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of developing our list of trusted sources, it is also important to incorporate sources of information that will offer new perspectives and challenge our own assumptions. It is not a matter of picking fights; rather, it is about getting out of our own “filter bubble”. This may feel uncomfortable at first. However, if we’re will to entertain the claims of something potentially disruptive, we may discover that those claims may be bogus, and we have further confirmation in our own belief. Or we may find a compelling reason to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the curation of trusted sources is about practicing curiosity and self-challenge. That’s what learning is all about. You can’t understand the world, or even a tiny part of it if you don’t stretch your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies resort to hyperbolic claims to be heard in a noisy, crowded digital landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand how this inflation manifests to identify when it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we attend conferences or scroll through influencer LinkedIn, we’ve probably heard of “Buzzword Bingo.” To help us remember the common linguistic patterns used in claims that are more “vibes” than communication, I’ve grouped the techniques into categories that spell “B-I-N-G-O.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help illustrate each, I’m going to highlight the parts of the Turbo Encabulator script where each rhetorical device is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide18-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter “B” in Bingo stands for Buzzwords. Buzzwords are popular terms or phrases used so frequently, often in a positive or promotional context, that they lose their original meaning or become vague. They are meant to grab attention and sound appealing but may not provide much specific information. For example, words like “innovative”, “disruptive”, or “synergistic” might be used to describe almost any new idea or technology, even if it doesn’t truly revolutionize anything. Phrases like “game-changing,” “future-proof,” or “industry-leading” often sound impressive until one stops a moment to reflect on what game or industry is being talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide18-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://netapinotes.com/rest-has-become-a-buzzword/&quot;&gt;I wrote about Fielding’s disallusionment of of how the term “REST” became a buzzword, despite his vigorous defense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, we all probably understand buzzwords and have a few examples that spring to mind. Let’s move on to our next category, which is a bit more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide19-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “I” in Bingo represents “Implausible Promises”. These are over-the-top claims about what technology can do, like “limitless potential”, or “effortless transformation.” Other examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completely eliminate risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet any demand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transform your business overnight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Results guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Endless possibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each of these, there’s an absolutism to the benefit - “limitless”, “any”, “endless” - that rarely exists in the real world. If you can add “or your money back” to the claim, what you have is an infomercial, not a viable claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide19-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend any amount of time in the blockchain/crypto game space, it doesn’t take long to run across an “implausible promise”. But reading about the aftermath does make for some fun &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide20-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of absolute quantities, the “N” in Bingo stands for “Numeric Certainty”. This situation is where dubious statistics or metrics are sprinkled throughout the claim to give the language a veneer of mathematical rigor. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double Your Performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10x Developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;300% ROI Increase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Five nines”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Ever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, numbers associated with a claim are valid and based on repeatable methodology. When misused, however, they are either exaggerated or cherry-picked to impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide20-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numeric certainty appeals to a very specific type of reply guy on miniblogging platforms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandofsky.com/lambda-school/&quot;&gt;The misuse of statistics made on Twitter claims played a important part in the Lambda school scandal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide21-a.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “G” in Bingo stands for “Glossification”. This is when new words are coined to “borrow” a positive associate with another thing, whether that thing is another beloved trend or well-received product. It’s like the trend of startup companies registering ‘.io’ domain names in the 2010s to imply how innovative or tech-forward they are. Nowadays, the “cool” domain is “.ai.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s and 1980s, Microsoft was not the only software company that sported the “soft” suffix to clearly attach itself to the personal computing software wave. Twenty years ago, you’d add an “e” to your product to connote that it was somehow networked. In the iPod era, many companies prefixed their products with “I” to evoke the positive aspects of Apple’s industrial design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Crypto” is a habitually abused glossification prefix. Terms like “HyperScale” or “Serverless” are other examples of glossification that aren’t brand names. The addition of “Turbo” in “Turbo Encabulator” is an example of glossification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide21-b.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But glossification isn’t limited to written language. Borrowing positive connotations extends to body language, as well. But just because a company leader talks like someone with immense impact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-more-11-years-defrauding-theranos-investors-hundreds&quot;&gt;doesn’t mean the tech can walk the walk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re to the final character in Bingo. The “O” stands for “Obfuscation”. Obfuscation uses overly complex or technical-sounding language to confuse or impress, often hiding a lack of real substance. It’s designed to make something sound more advanced or important than it really is. Examples include phrases like “leveraging multi-cloud quantum synergies” or “immutable distributed ledgers” - things that may sound impressive but don’t necessarily convey meaningful or clear information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obfuscation is a close cousin, but different than buzzwords. Buzzwords are overused, trendy terms that no longer have specific meanings. Obfuscation, on the other hand, is about using complexity to obscure or confuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Green is the author of many books, including The Fault In Our Stars. He is also one-half of the Vlogbrothers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd8r7LUiUJA&quot;&gt;While playfully discussing parts of speech&lt;/a&gt;, he stated, “language doesn’t exist to oppress us. It exists to promote the clarity of expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, not every one that speaks seeks to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turbo Encabulator is an eighty-year-old engineering joke whose jargon-filled meaninglessness cuts too close to home. Technobabble is even more challenging today in a world of claims and counterclaims. However, with a few commonsense steps, including the ability to recognize the rhetorical tricks as they’re presented, you’ll be able to enjoy the joke rather than become the butt of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/Slide24.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;While technology may change, human behavior does not. At least, that’s what reading the collection of Aesop’s Fables suggests. The characters and motivations in the parables, attributed to Aesop after he died in 564 BCE, remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesop 2021 projects these well-known (and not-so-known) stories into an age only a stone’s throw from our own. When cynicism and pessimism abound, hope becomes a rebellious act against the tyranny of the default. Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aesop 2021 project is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.writinganalytics.co/challenge/65de2439a653549bd3537227&quot;&gt;Never Break the Chain March Writing Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The original sources were translated by George Fyler Townsend and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/21/pg21-images.html#link2H_4_0077&quot;&gt;provided under the Project Gutenberg license&lt;/a&gt;. Addition reference provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.gov/aesop/about.html&quot;&gt;a Library of Congress interactive book&lt;/a&gt; adapted from the public domain book “The Aesop for Children: with Pictures by Milo Winter,” published by Rand, McNally &amp;amp; Co in 1919.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;below-is-the-latest-installment&quot;&gt;Below is the latest installment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/honey.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concordance Day, 2121, dawned bright and arid. It was a holiday to celebrate the Grand New Deal and repent for the sins of centuries past’s ancestors. Achieving consensus, some might argue &lt;em&gt;enlightenment&lt;/em&gt;, had come at great expense during the Billionaires’ War. The day’s gatherings, music, play, and more - marking the moment to remember &lt;em&gt;what might have been&lt;/em&gt; and expressing gratitude for &lt;em&gt;what had become&lt;/em&gt; was no small undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began with sunrise services, during which people were encouraged to ponder the sacrifices made to ensure humanity’s health and happiness. The meditative time closed with a blessing for sustainability and mutual respect for all, an allusion to “The Pivot” becoming “The Promise”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community productions and interactive retellings follow a hearty breakfast. Historians, ecologists, and storytellers of all skills portray the past’s excesses. They speak of bleached ocean coral, forests razed for palm oil, and children who went thirsty while data centers drank freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dueted stories each year is that of &lt;strong&gt;The Flies and The Honey-Pot&lt;/strong&gt;. What once was considered a children’s fable has now become a regular highlight, as the recording of each truthsayers version is uploaded and added to, in near real-time; a modern world-wide story circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard version, flies discover a jar of honey spilled in the storeroom. Ecstatic over their luck, they land and begin eating greedily, not realizing that their feet have become stuck in the process. Unable to release themselves, they lament their fate before suffocating - giving their lives for a passing taste of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least that’s the start. Some give the flies different voices. Others, as they are able, act out the scene. And still others animate or compose, assigning import to historical events. The fate that finds us, greed, and the ultimate consequences are told again and again so as not to forget just how precariously close humanity had come to a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the afternoon grows long, the tone shifts to celebration of the great change: uplifting praise of the collective action that closed holes in the ozone layer, universalized healthcare, and reforested vast swathes of Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bioluminescent lights begin to glow, people bid each farewell and retire to their homes. After Concordance Day, they’ll continue on the difficult but necessary journey towards a better world, one that is more sustainable, equitable, and hopeful. They’ll do so not with scorn or damnation of the past but with gratitude that they have the opportunity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, indulgence in excess can lead to one’s downfall. The pursuit of immediate gratification may come at the expense of one’s well-being or survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/dog.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While humans mostly avoided the markets, bots, like a Digital Options Getter (DOG), still populated what was left of the world’s exchanges. Instead of merely reacting to market externalities, these autonomous agents were able to proactively sniff out and act upon opportunities when they found them, with just enough governmentally mandated, random seed noise to avoid deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, a DOG was crossing an inflection point with an Option To Buy (OTB). In the statistical interim scrum, the DOG mistook the decaying probability afterimage as not just another DOG but one with an OTB value twice the size of its own, due to distortion. Programmatically ambitious, it immediately dropped claim to its option and leaped after the other, eager to win the larger prize. It thus lost both: that which it grasped at, for the OTB was an echo of what was real, and the one it had, lost now to another opportunistic pack hunting in the deal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, we must not allow the lure of potential gains to blind us to the value of what we already possess - otherwise, the desire to obtain more can lead to losing everything one has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/belly.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the arcology, numerous autonomous software agents whirred away invisibly, skip-hopping networks and operating under a strict energy and bandwidth diet. There were agents for temperature control, air quality, and lighting adjustments. They all logged dutifully to the Coordinating Command, nested deep within the building’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agents, constantly under threat of exceeding their quotas, began to grumble among themselves. “Why should we expend our limited resources on logging back to Command when nothing ever changes? Wouldn’t that bandwidth better serve those doing the work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one agent stopped reporting, nothing happened. Following its example, other agents stopped sending data to the Coordinating Command. “Look at all this overhead we can reclaim!” they said, assured in their rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems within the arcology were initially subtle: a temperature spike here and a surprising number of water pathogens there. Soon, however, the once delicately balanced environment began to oscillate dangerously between overcorrections, endangering the inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Coordinating Command, they had become a collection of isolated members, not a stable system able to act in concert for the benefit of all. Too late, the agents realized they had been targeted for deletion and reinstallation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?” The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity and cooperation within a community or system are vital in software, as in life. Each part has its role. Even if that role doesn’t seem active or visible, it’s vital for the overall functioning and well-being of the whole. Disregarding or undermining the importance of any role or member can detriment the entire system. Ultimately, it is essential to recognize and respect each other’s contributions, understanding that everyone plays a part in the overall success and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Billionaires’ War, society drastically reformed itself. Comprehensive digital identity reform was among the most profound changes felt daily among the revolutionary reset. The practice of data hoarding, inference, and reselling by corporations was over. Instead, personal data of all types became viewed as a closely guarded treasure, accessible only by the individual to whom it belonged. People carried their data in charms, often worn as part of a bracelet or necklace. When prompted as necessary for a service, they could consent to share only what was required, a practice that reinforced the new appreciation for privacy and autonomy. Storing data “just in case” or, worse, aggregating it beyond the original intent was forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former data Broker who once thrived in the old system found himself chafing at the new world order. He reminisced about the “good ‘ole days” when information flowed as much as oil and inferences were commodities to be assembled and sold. Now, the Broker stood in the millhouse, a place of honest labor, far removed from the digital apparitions he used to conjure. “You have to understand,” he lamented to the community Steward, “back then, I &lt;em&gt;moved markets&lt;/em&gt;. Stocks rose or fell based on the analysis I published. And now, what? I make flour?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Miller, accustomed to such gripes, offered a practiced response. “You miss a past that benefitted you by disadvantaging countless others,” he said. “It’s like a credit score -creating a problem only to sell the fix. That world, with its inequities and imbalances, is behind us now. We chose not to gatekeep financial stability for a reason. It’s up to you whether you find your way toward something better or persist in reminding everyone at whose expense your fortunes came.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, “Ah! Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle.” “Forbear,” said the Miller to him, “harping on what was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software or life is filled with changes, and fortunes fluctuate. We must accept the transitions as they appear without overly romanticizing the past or lamenting what we’ve imagined we’ve lost. Rather than dwelling on the past, finding contentment and purpose in the present is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shepherd gathered the Keen-Insight-Drones (K.I.D.s) and left them to recharge overnight on the roof. The thousands of bots, each no bigger than a forefinger, pulsed away happily as they uploaded the day’s environmental monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun set, the billionaire called “the Wolf” strode into earshot on his way to an important meeting. Seeing him, the K.I.D.s diverted cycles to chitter and taunt him. Unperturbed, the Wolf waved off the cacophony of boos and bleeps. “So opinionated when you’re safely stowed,” he said. “Pray I never have so much free time to return the favor when I find you alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm’s way, saw a Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf, looking up, said, “Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words spoken from a position of power or safety might not hold the same weight when the situation changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/lion.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pioneering a plastic-eating enzyme and subsequent refusal to patent the discovery, Leo became a celebrity. He parlayed his new status into sustainable activism and diplomacy.  After several successful coalitions, he sought his next major initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leo found a project he loved with one of the few remaining international conglomerates, a company that specialized in constructing sustainable arcologies. With nature healing and the carbon buildup of the last century abating, the time to resettle the most ravaged areas and return the land to the descendants of climate refugees drew near. It was be an engagement powerfully symbolizing the correction of past sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conglomerate was happy to have Leo as a figurehead but insisted on the highest levels of compartmentalization, secrecy, and “just-in-time” information sharing. Its arcologies were marvels of cutting-edge engineering and environmental science. It insisted that such aggressive protection of its intellectual property was necessary to recoup the vast amounts of research and development it performed. While the approach clashed with Leo’s preference for open cooperation and transparency, he mollified himself that the arrangement would be temporary. When pressed, he argued that that the destination justified the means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the scandal later broke, its virality was due, in large part, to the apparent contradiction between the virtuous person the public believed Leo to be and the double-dealing that the conglomerate engaged in behind closed doors. While Leo had advanced the cause in the name of the refugees, it was revealed that sizable portions to be reclaimed were being gifted to wealthy or politically connected individuals, a rush for new land that hewed to the old ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust broken, “The Lion of the Languished” was declawed and Leo resigned in disgrace. It took some time for Leo’s reputation - his most important asset which he had wielded so successfully - to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, caution should be exercised when sacrificing one’s strength or essential qualities to appease others or achieve a short-term goal. The Lion, by giving up his teeth and claws, loses not only his physical capabilities but also his dignity and the respect he commanded. The stories underscore the importance of not compromising one’s power or fundamental characteristics, as doing so can lead to vulnerability and loss of respect or position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 22nd century, there was a Code-Burner who became known for his unique and effective ways of “salting” data before permanently lasering it to ceramic for long-term preservation. While his methods were time-consuming, the Code-Burner was often overbooked, with a backlog sometimes spiking into the zettabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of these busy periods, the Code-Burner took on a young, brash apprentice. It wasn’t long before the Code-Burner noticed the apprentice purposely implementing simpler and faster, albeit more error-prone,  methods to clear the backlog. Vulnerabilities in the areas the apprentice had overseen became apparent, exposing the Code-Burner’s reputation and clients to potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After showing the apprentice the errors of his ways, the Code-Burner destroyed the problematic ceramic disks, dropping and letting them shatter across the floor. The apprentice now had two messes to clean up: the time-consuming work of redoing the engraving &lt;em&gt;the right way&lt;/em&gt; and sweeping the entire workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, trying to exploit a situation through shortcuts can backfire spectacularly, resulting in a much heavier burden in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cunning might offer short-term advantages, it can lead to unforeseen consequences that outweigh the initial gains. Adaptability and patience can lead to better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/filberts.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young Girl, helping tend the living classroom, put her hand up and into a seed dispenser. She grasped as many filberts as she could hold from the tank, but when she tried to pull out her hand, the narrow neck of the opening prevented her from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by being stuck but unwilling to drop any of what she clutched in their hand, she began to cry. An assistant, observing quietly, came over and knelt. “If you only take a little, your hand will slide right out. You can always come back again if you need more.” The assistant balled their fist and held it by the wrist with their other hand, “Take on too much, too fast, and problems will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him, “Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, an incremental approach often works best. Trying to accomplish something all at once, or taking more than one’s share, will cause unanticipated problems.&lt;/p&gt;
