        <title>Facebook, Regulation, and Who Controls the Kitchen Sink</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Cambridge-Analytica, Facebook seems to be taking the wrong lessons from the incident (or, if I’m cynical, they’re skewing in a direction that cements their market dominance). They are correct that the loss of trust is so much bigger than whatever terms of service Cambridge Analytica violated. However, the stated conclusion that there is a binary relationship between data portability and privacy - that either everything must be shared or Facebook controls everything - is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018/03/facebook-apology.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, concerns over Facebook’s data collection practices reached an all-time fever pitch. I had intended on sharing my thoughts, along with a handful of recommended takeaways for API providers, as part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/RESTAPINotes/archive&quot;&gt;REST API Notes&lt;/a&gt;. However, the longer I compiled breaking news, the longer the piece became. Eventually, it seemed warranted to break Facebook off into its own dedicated post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to be thorough, but “uncritical” set sail awhile ago. I’m biased. People, like techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, raised the alarm years ago, when meaningful action could have been taken.  &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/01/CodifiedCulturalBias/&quot;&gt;I left Facebook around the same time over concerns on the power uber data aggregators wield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those protestations, Facebook’s practices continued. It doesn’t appear that the internal conversations ever switched from “can we?” to “should we?” And now the mob, embittered and frustrated by the cultural malaise of the moment, are coming with torches and regulatory pitchforks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About. Goddamn. Time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-March, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot;&gt;improperly acquired the private data&lt;/a&gt; of approximately 50 million Facebook users. It then, subsequently, used the psychological profiles it created with the data to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Obama campaign, in 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1189&amp;amp;v=LGiiQUMaShw&quot;&gt;also ingested Facebook relationship data&lt;/a&gt;. However, while the Obama campaign was transparent that people were giving their information (and their friends’ information) to the cause of re-electing Obama, the Trump campaign used data culled from a personality quiz app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app used the 1.0 version of the Facebook’s Graph API. That version launched in April, 2010 and allowed developers to “not only see the social connection between people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/21/zuckerbergs-buildin-web-default-social/&quot;&gt;but see and create the connections people have with their interests - things, places, brands, and other sites&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; information is needed before profound insights can be inferred about a person. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090328103238/http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/dataprivacy/HIPAA/HIPAAcomments.html&quot;&gt;A Carnegie Mellon study has shown&lt;/a&gt;, 87% of Americans can be positively identified using only a 5-digit postal code, gender, and date of birth. Full name, postal code, and date of birth equate to voter rolls, which themselves are sold by many states. Using nothing but likes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/06/1218772110&quot;&gt;researchers Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel have successfully shown they can predict a wide range of sensitive personal attributes&lt;/a&gt; including “sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, version 1.0 of the Graph API didn’t just make information about a specific user available; it allowed “extended permissions”. This feature allowed approved apps to request a range of users’ &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt;, along with their information. This additional information &lt;em&gt;did not require the consent of those friends before it was shared&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to Personally Identifiable Information (or PII), this friend information included education, groups, hometown, interests, location, relationships, religion, work history, etc. Having understanding of information flow is powerful; according to one study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/03/26/information-flow-reveals-prediction-limits-in-online-social-activity/&quot;&gt;‘95% of the potential predictive accuracy attainable for an individual is available within the social ties of that individual only, without requiring the individual’s data’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A University of Cambridge professor, Aleksadr Kogan, created an app called &lt;em&gt;thisisyourdigitallife&lt;/em&gt;. Built using Facebook’s Graph API, he seeded the initial userbase with people paid through Amazon’s “Mechanical Turk”. Subsequently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/opinion/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html&quot;&gt;around 270,000 people were paid between $1 and $2 to download and use the personality quiz app&lt;/a&gt;. Through the use of ‘extended permissions’ the initial 270,000 users resulted in 50 million populated profiles; profiles containing the names, dates of birth, employment history, likes, and more. Aleksadr then gave the information he collected to Cambridge Analytica. &lt;em&gt;Technically&lt;/em&gt;, only the last step violated Facebook’s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph 1.0 was deprecated on April 2014 (and access ended entirely in 2015). The second version of the Graph API, while providing information for the conscenting user, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23417356/facebook-graph-api-v2-0-me-friends-returns-empty-or-only-friends-who-also-u&quot;&gt;no longer has extended permissions&lt;/a&gt;. However, the data collected by external entities during this time cannot be expunged; revoking access does nothing to the apps that might have had access and saved themselves a copy. The data is out there, on who-knows-how-many private servers, with the potential to be purchased, aggregated with other datasets, and weaponized for future scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/my-cow-game-extracted-your-facebook-data/556214/&quot;&gt;as the author of the Facebook game ‘Cow Clicker’ stated&lt;/a&gt;, “all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the abuses didn’t stop when Graph 1.0 was fully shutdown in 2015. Other Facebook products, like Instagram’s API, &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.instagram.com/blog/new-instagram-api-features&quot;&gt;still exhibit similar behavior&lt;/a&gt;. In March, 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://promarket.org/roger-mcnamee-think-can-make-legitimate-case-facebook-become-parasitic/&quot;&gt;Facebook expelled a group that was using its API to scrape data about people who expressed interest in Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;. The group had been selling the data to police departments. At the end of the same year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/hud-has-serious-concerns-about-facebooks-ethnic-targeting&quot;&gt;the Department of Housing and Urban Development launched an investigation following concerns that Facebook’s advertising tools allow real estate advertisers to discriminate users according to race&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/5215274/facebook-messenger-android-call-text-message-data/&quot;&gt;has also admitted to collecting call and text message history of users who own Android phones&lt;/a&gt; (while users were asked if they wanted to import their phone contacts, it was not obvious to many users that they were agreeing to have their cell phone activity recorded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180321/17312239474/mark-zuckerberg-finally-speaks-about-cambridge-analytica-it-wont-be-enough.shtml&quot;&gt;responded last Wednesday afternoon, outlining reactive steps to the situation&lt;/a&gt;: Facebook would &lt;em&gt;investigate old apps that used v1.0&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;further restrict access to data&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;give more transparency and control to end users&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180318/00111439443/both-facebook-cambridge-analytica-threatened-to-sue-journalists-over-stories-cas-use-facebook-data.shtml&quot;&gt;threatened to sue&lt;/a&gt; the journalists that broke the original story. This seems, primarily, over the erroneous use of the word “breach” in the course of describing events; if determined to be a data breach (which this wasn’t), the company could face fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, Facebook seems to be taking the wrong lessons from the incident (or, if I’m cynical, they’re skewing in a direction that cements their market dominance). They are correct that the loss of trust is so much bigger than whatever terms of service Cambridge Analytica violated. However, the stated conclusion that there is a binary relationship between data portability and privacy - that either everything must be shared or Facebook controls everything - is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180321/17312239474/mark-zuckerberg-finally-speaks-about-cambridge-analytica-it-wont-be-enough.shtml&quot;&gt;Techdirt summarized the round of media interviews that Mark Zuckerberg did, where he said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I was maybe too idealistic on the side of data portability, that it would create more good experiences — and it created some — but I think what the clear feedback from our community was that people value privacy a lot more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, he bemoans having to make these kinds of tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I guess I have to, because of [where we are] now, but I’d rather not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If consumers &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; control, it would take Mark out of the leadership role that he is, apparently, uncomfortable playing.  Why &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; someone easily be able to bulk-delete “likes” older than a year? Why is it necessary for Facebook to retain work history older than the last employer? Sexual orientation, race, and religious affiliation can get someone killed - so why can’t people indicate that these should never be stored, or even &lt;em&gt;inferred&lt;/em&gt; - as part of their profile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most valuable part of Facebook, for an individual, is not the status updates, or the images uploaded - it is the network of connections they’ve built. This is why so many apps, unable to get the social graph from Facebook, resort to the kludge of the “access your contacts” email workaround. If the individual chose, why couldn’t they take those relationships (sans ‘extended permissions’ data) with them somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than allow apps to hoover up the kind of information useful for psyops, why not allow developers to create 3rd party tools for permissions configuration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/why-we-didnt-make-fix-my-facebook-privacy-settings-tool&quot;&gt;the kind Cory Doctorow wrote about&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, because there is little market incentive for Facebook to do so. Till now, the profitable thing has not aligned with the right thing. As Doc Searls has written, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/03/23/nothing/&quot;&gt;this is a problem not just for Facebook, but for an entire online publishing industry dependent on building advertising panopticons for revenue growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulation, above and beyond what currently exists, is coming. It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make a difference. However, ideas currently swirling entrench Facebook as the market leader, with little likelihood of alternatives arising. An example is the European ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/gdpr_risk_to_the_duopoly/&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;’ (GDPR). It goes into effect May, 2018. Some have hailed it as progress toward defining when user consent is necessary. It also has provisions for data portability. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mydata/gdpr-data-portability-is-a-false-promise-af460d35a629&quot;&gt;there are already workarounds devised, with the social graph considered a “legitimate interest” of the social network&lt;/a&gt;. As a ‘legitimate interest’ of the business, it is not privy to export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Techdirt summarized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Solving” the problem isn’t going to be solving the problem for real – and it’s just going to end up giving Facebook greater power over our data. That’s an unfortunate result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need is thoughtful, not knee-jerk, regulation. We need consumer-friendly policies that promote the principles of the open web and eschew monopolies. We need to treat personal data with the kind of care and responsibility that we do with powerful, and potentially dangerous, things in the real world. And we need to look for answers outside of Facebook, because there’s few incentives to drive the necessary change from within.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Role of Product Management in API Design</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The handles of a craftman’s tools bespeak an absolute simplicity, the plainest forms affording the greatest range of possibilitites for the user’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That which is overdesigned, too highly specific, anticipates outcome; the anticipation of the outcomes guarantees, if not failure, the absence of grace.” - William Gibson, &lt;em&gt;All Tomorrow’s Parties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018/03/management-books.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture of product management books on a bookstore shelf, taken from Morguefile.com&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful APIs, whether they are external products or internal glue, require strong product management. However, given an API’s ephemeral nature, product managers may have difficulty with how to proceed. This poor API product management results in a product that doesn’t meet the needs of users. Adoption will be limited. Integrations, when they do happen, will be difficult. And correcting mistakes after development will remain a demoralizing and expensive proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Eriksson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/&quot;&gt;defines the Product Manager role as an expertise that lies at the intersection of tech, business, and UX&lt;/a&gt;. Martin then quotes the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/&quot;&gt;Inspired&lt;/a&gt;, that states a product manager should ‘discover a product that is valuable, usable and feasible’. What constitutes “valuable”, “usable”, and “feasible” for an API?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;valuable&quot;&gt;Valuable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the most fundamental level, an API must provide a useful function. Determining what is useful and what is not is the first job for an API product manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-for-the-correct-audience&quot;&gt;Building for the Correct Audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product managers should understand the audience that will consume the API. That may be easier than it sounds, as there actually several different types of people evaluating an API, each with their own questions. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfults.com/the-best-api-documentation-b9e46400379a&quot;&gt;Brad Fults mentions&lt;/a&gt;, these audiences may include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Makers&lt;/strong&gt; evaluating competing API products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers&lt;/strong&gt; looking to get started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrators&lt;/strong&gt; attempting to debug a specific issue in an existing client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each audience has different needs. For the decision maker, is the functionality provided by an API the same, if not better, than other competitive offerings? Can a developer get started with an API easily, perhaps with nothing more than a CURL statement? Does the API return the type of error messages that, when things go wrong, make it easy for an integrator to fix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;api-design-that-is-outside-in-not-reflections-of-internal-implementations&quot;&gt;API Design that is ‘Outside In’, not Reflections of Internal Implementations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API design should align with the integrator’s understanding. Creating an interface constrained to the internal systems implementation is rarely a good idea. These systems, particularly those that have existed in legacy environments, are a complex aggregation of shifting business priorities, technical advancement, team experience, etc. Exposing years (if not decades) of ‘dirty laundry’ at once significantly increases the barriers to comprehension and adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clear-ownership&quot;&gt;Clear Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product management includes a degree of ownership. The part of ownership that integrators care about is the amount, and form, that ownership is exhibited in. Trust in an API is difficult to earn and can be easily fumbled away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ownership of an API translates to the following communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uptime Dashboard/SLA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change Log/Release Notes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Known and Communicated Support and Feedback Channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual forms may vary. But each of these is an attempt to convey stability and permanence - two crucial elements when wooing developers with other options. A product with a future and team behind it is orders of magnitude more desirable than unmaintained code deployed on a computer under someone’s desk. A product manager should ensure that the former is being communicated, not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usable&quot;&gt;Usable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of different approaches for web-based APIs. Whether using RPC, REST, or subsequent variations, an API design produced by one team may vary significantly in usage and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amundsen.com/blog/archives/1109&quot;&gt;affordances&lt;/a&gt; from another team’s product - even when both teams work for the same company! The number of design choices, and how they subsequently manifest in the design, require additional work to ensure the designs are usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of differences means that documentation is incredibly important. In fact, in John Musser’s talk, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/ten-reasons-developershateyourapi/&quot;&gt;Ten Reasons Developers Hate Your API&lt;/a&gt;”, “sucky” documentation was listed as the &lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;/strong&gt; API problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons that documentation may suck include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being inaccurate/out-of-date/incomplete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lacking a getting started onramp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unprofessional and/or lacking clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of various formats that capture API intent in structured ways, like the OpenAPI specification, are a start. These &lt;em&gt;integration contracts&lt;/em&gt; can be used to &lt;em&gt;render&lt;/em&gt; documentation in a manner similar to how annotations in a Java codebase can render Javadoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like Javadocs, this “documentation” is often the bare minimum that can be done towards effective communication and understanding. An API product manager should be closely involved in the creation of an API’s documentation. They should ensure that the business value of their product is clearly captured to the intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;standards&quot;&gt;Standards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common design consideration is “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment&quot;&gt;the principle of least surprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;”. Design works best when it reuses familiar interface concepts. With a user interface (UI), this allows end users to make successful educated guesses, resulting in better user experience (UX). This developer experience, or “DX” should be part of the consideration when creating an API design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common industry patterns for should be used. Where possible, data should adhere standards, and those standards explicitly referenced in the documentation. For example, why force a consumer to create their own parsing for your bespoke date and time format? Use ISO8601 instead, reference it in the documentation, and be done with it. Extra points if the API design takes advantage of the work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/&quot;&gt;schema.org&lt;/a&gt; and properly uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml&quot;&gt;media types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feasible&quot;&gt;Feasible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different integrations will have different consumptions needs. Some may be able to consume the entire payload as designed. Others, do to computational or bandwidth constraints, may want a refined perspective on the resource available. Working with potential consumers to build in rate controls from the beginning is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;malleability&quot;&gt;Malleability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for sort ordering and pagination on returned collections is important. Default return amounts, rather than to defaulting to the entire collection, should be explicitly stated in the documentation and modifiable (within reason - page size limits should also be explicitly called out). Filtering, depending on the collection size, may be important. A more advanced option, depending on the need, is to allow for selective parameter retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cacheability&quot;&gt;Cacheability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APIs should take advantage of the idempotent and safe natures available on the appropriate endpoints. Services enhance cache-ability by setting headers on responses. These headers, at a minimum, include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pragma&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last-Modified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to use the ETag header for validating the freshness of cached representations, as well as helping with conditional read and update operations. Its value is an arbitrary string for the version of a representation, sometimes a simple hash of the underlying object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A product manager may not understand the &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; technical mechanisms behind how these headers work. However, they should desire the best customer experience possible, and - for many - that means zippy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Sturgeon has a couple of fantastic pieces on HTTP caching. The first is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/speeding-up-apis-apps-smart-toasters-with-http-response-caching-a67becf829c6&quot;&gt;a blog post on how to speed up API performance with HTTP response caching&lt;/a&gt;. The second is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoVFGnpqpM&quot;&gt;a presentation he recently gave that was posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a lot to manage, it’s because it is. Being a product manager for an API comes with all the research and testing of a normal product, but with an additional dash of technical acumen and developer savvy. But the reward - easier integrations, more developer happiness, and better expressions of business value - is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Securing APIs and Microservice Mashups &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Only the thorniest of thorny topics in this week's REST API Notes. First, Kristopher Sandoval talks about securing APIs. Next, Patrick Lee Scott identifies and articulates a number of microservice design patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and jet-setting security guy, Troy Hunt, has dropped a new version of his Pwnded Password service. That alone would be news. However, he did it in conjunction with a brand-spanking &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; API.

        <title>Model Actions, Not Data &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is 2018, and far too many API designs still start with their data model. This inward focus, turned external, aligns poorly with integrator expectations. Mike Amundsen breaks a blog silence to remind folks of that modeling &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt;, not data, is a fundamental design necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, Tom Wilkie provides a compelling methodology for microservice performance metrics. Jimmy Bogard covers acres of ground in his &lt;em&gt;Microservices FAQ&lt;/em&gt;. Finally there's a heaping ton of free, downloadable resources for those looking for long-form reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>REST is the new SOAP? &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;REST can be difficult. I get it. But throwing one's hands up in the air, and coining a thinkpiece of all the ways an architectural approach has personally wronged your sensibilitites is... tiresome. In this edition of the RESTful API notes, Mark Little and Phil Sturgeon deconstruct the straw men. There's also a nice preso on &quot;Surviving microservices&quot;. For bonus points, there's a theoretical model for determining the cost of API versioniong. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RIP John Perry Barlow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;John Perry Barlow did many amazing things. He was a Grateful Dead lyricist. He was a Wyoming rancher for more than a decade and a half, itself no small feat. Much too late in my professional career I contributed to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an organization he founded to fight for a free and open internet. However, JPB will be most notable, for me, as the author of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence&quot;&gt;Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPB wrote the manifesto as an email in 1996. Even in the wide-eye days of the web’s infancy, it was controversial. Arrogant. Eye-roll inducing. In light of everything today - from &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-real-story-of-stuxnet&quot;&gt;nation state cyber-warfare&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2014/06/05/edward-snowden-revelations/&quot;&gt;the Snowden revelations&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/here-are-the-election-facebook-ads-russia-bought-1513306606-f8d07e39-085f-44e7-9958-975d35d3b4f0.html&quot;&gt;Facebook manipulating elections&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/us/kansas-police-shooting-swatting/index.html&quot;&gt;people dying from swatting&lt;/a&gt; - it is hard not to choke on the naivety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the loss of that innocence, and the visionary who articulated what the web &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be, &lt;strong&gt;hurts so much&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same year that JPB declared cyberspace’s independence, I started my freshman year at college. His web became the web I aspired to. In addition to the manifesto, I was also quickly introduced to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, 90’s British Rave Culture, Hacking, Phreaking, IRC, Napster, Icecasting, Pseudo, and so much, much more. Instead of fiddling with index cards, report research was just an AltaVista search away. I learned HTML on a Geocities site so that I could share the same miserable poetry as others from exotic locations like Europe, or Australia, or Des Moine. And music; there was so much music. Music to study to, music to make-out to, and music to ring in a new millenium where anyone with an ounce of ambition and a newly minted degree in computers could save the world (while getting fabulously rich in the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dot-com bust turned out to be a speed bump. In 2004-2005, I was a regular listener of podcasts and ran a web forum for an MMORPG guild. By 2007, I was all in on ‘Web 2.0’, or ‘The Social Web’. Friends attending SXSW that year invited me to try something called ‘Twitter’. By the end of that year, I was producing (poorly attended) conferences extolling the virtues of blogging for businesses. &lt;em&gt;Brands would be conversational, not unidirectional&lt;/em&gt;! Businesses could harness the &lt;em&gt;wisdom of the crowds&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cluetrain.com/&quot;&gt;All aboard the Cluetrain&lt;/a&gt;! “&lt;strong&gt;If only&lt;/strong&gt;,” I would argue without irony, “&lt;strong&gt;everyone would blog, we’d see we aren’t really that different!&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting here, writing on a private VPN network, in a browser meticulously stripped of as much ad tracking as I can manage, with a sticker slapped over the webcam, I’m humbled. This isn’t the web &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want. &lt;em&gt;This isn’t the web he wanted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBP saw physical space’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_upon_a_Hill&quot;&gt;city on the hill&lt;/a&gt; for what it was - a gated community of power and privilege that looked down on those different or unwanted. He called for something new. However, it is important to point out that JPB’s dream for cyberspace wasn’t an appeal for lawlessness; his streak of libertarianism wasn’t ‘do whatever you want’. It was an appeal to be something better than we’ve been. The blackest backwaters of Reddit, or the white power movement, or malware opportunists were inevitable, but unwelcome. He was in a race to sow the seeds of something wonderful before the weeds of our worst nature could take root and choke it out. In JBP’s “new home of Mind”, we’d see a vision of a virtual place beyond the violence beget of physical judgement and maybe, just maybe, we’d finally treat each other like human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now John Perry Barlow is dead. A mantle has been laid down and its owner put to rest. Cyberspace is dead. Long live cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>API Days 2018 &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;API Days 2018 was held in Paris. Thankfully, for those of us who were unable to attend, many of the best slides were shared online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also take a few moments to mark John Perry Barlow's passing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hypermedia, Swagger, and More &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This edition of the REST API notes starts with a review of a tool review (very meta). Not to be outdone, I then move to hypermedia extractions and end with a look at JSON Hyper-Schema. Before I begin loving a post professing to loving love or hating on the haters who ever hated I call it an update with some interesting industry milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web APIs: 2018 and Beyond &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have we reached &lt;strong&gt;peak microservices&lt;/strong&gt;? Sure, the architectural pattern is powerful. But have we gone round the bend and arrived at hypetown? Now that stories of actual implementations are being shared, will the cost of increased complexity hijack the primary narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pondering the ramifications for the coming year, I also talk about numerous other trends: service meshes, reactive microservices, webhooks/pubsub, and more. It's an accessment of the horizon. While we may not make it everywhere, there's a fair amount of ground we'll cover in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2017 Laid to REST &amp;#x2709;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At year's end, there's a handful of notable articles to highlight before heading out for the holidays. In this edition of the REST API notes, it is worth covering a bit of API Design thinking, revisiting the benefits semi-structured representations, and why microservice contracts are so useful. If the term &quot;&lt;em&gt;evolutionary compatibility&lt;/em&gt;&quot; isn't top of mind, read on for more.&lt;/p&gt;
