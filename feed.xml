                <description>&lt;p&gt;While technology may change, human behavior does not. At least, that’s what reading the collection of Aesop’s Fables suggests. The characters and motivations in the parables, attributed to Aesop after he died in 564 BCE, remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesop 2021 projects these well-known (and not-so-known) stories into an age only a stone’s throw from our own. When cynicism and pessimism abound, hope becomes a rebellious act against the tyranny of the default. Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/lioness.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, around the fishing hole, the developers who were casting about for software solutions started a friendly debate among themselves. Each fisherman boasted about the volume they caught and reassembled, but none could agree upon the best productivity metric. With no arguments reaching consensus, the group stowed their equipment and sought out the Loiness, an elder of great renown and architect in her own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found her walking in the gardens. With much joshing, they demanded to know who had the most plentiful body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lioness laughed at them and said, “Long ago, the amount we could create effectively became infinite, yet here you are arguing over who has more. That is the scarcity mindset. Making and maintaining the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing?” She continued, “&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the mindset of enlightenment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. “And you,” they said, “how many sons have you at a birth?” The Lioness laughed at them, and said: “Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s total contribution should be thought of as depth and impact; two things that may be beyond easy summation. The value is in the worth, not in the number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/farming.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Father farmed with his family of Sons beyond where the commuter rail ends, the vast expanses where the permaculture systems cover kilometers. The Sons constantly bickered over everything from plot use to energy application, and nothing the Father said did any good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, when the Sons were nearly at each other’s throats, the Father asked each of them to bring him a solar module under repair. He had them run a meter over it and noted the charge. He then had them remove the photovoltaic shingles for each of his Sons to read one by one. The energy was a fraction of the panel when it was even detectable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“United,” said the Father, “we have power. Together, these shingles shade the crops when the sun is harsh and take the worst of the hail when it storms. We irrigate less and feed more.  If you let others divide you, you’re no stronger than a single shingle in that array - something people of the old ways will use against you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves. No words he could say did the least good, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking example that should make them see that discord would lead them to misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one. This they did very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My Sons,” said the Father, “do you not see how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are divided among yourselves, you will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, individuals can withstand challenges and adversities much better when they work together and support one another.  Embracing a diversity of opinions and experiences will mean there will be conflict. However, our energies are better served by discovering peaceful ways of compromise and resolution rather than division and escalation. There is strength in unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/bear.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the evening shade grew long, the Code-Burners, Fishermen, and any migrant Fixers passing through would gather in the commons. While each had a professional interest in being there, more often than not, the evening would slip into night with rollicking tall tales and screening of the latest whopper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one of these forums, a Bear began to boast of their skills. “Out of everyone here, I am the most user-friendly,” they proclaimed. “While you’re still sorting out what ends up in your error messages and stressing your operators out, I just suppress them!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Fox overheard Bear’s declarations and paused their gesture control. “Really, Bear? Maybe instead of hiding messages when things go wrong, how much more helpful would it be if you focused on preventing errors from happening in the first place?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, “Oh! that you would eat the dead and not the living.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, professing virtues or positive qualities means little if one’s actions do not support the claims. We need to be alert against superficial or false displays of respect. Instead, we should look at the practical outcomes of someone’s behavior. In short, we should value deeds over words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/stork.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the vast, distributed social network of the 22nd century, a Farmer set about a trap for those he suspected of market manipulation. An agent surfaced with peculiar frequency: Stork, a being entwined in a complex web of digital interactions across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stork protested mightily about the unfairness of the situation when confronted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Certainly,” he said over chat, “there has been some mistake. My only crime was accepting every friend request and follow. I was only trying to build an impressive list of contacts. I didn’t realize, at the time, what some of these others might have been up to. Just look at my profile - I’m a good person!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Farmer laughed. “While what you say when caught says one thing, your connections imply something else. The shadows cast extend far beyond any one individual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. “Pray save me, Master,” he said, “and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers—they are not the least like those of a Crane.” The Farmer laughed aloud and said, “It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, you are judged by the company that you keep. The quality of one’s connections far outweighs the quantity. Indiscriminately lending your reputation to others can lead to unforeseen consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/fisherman.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the solarpunk 22nd century, software development was vastly abstracted from the rote assembly that had come before. Where once creating executable functions required carefully crafted trains of inscrutable squiggles, future developers “fished” for their solutions, hoping to hook functionality from a vast ocean of probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this world, that a Fisherman, skilled in music, stood at the digital shoreline looking to seed a solution. He played several tunes hoping his latest melodies would attract the components needed onto his net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after nearly completing his playlist but receiving nary a nibble, the Fisherman switched tacks. While more comfortable with musical composition than elocution, he gradually found the words necessary to bait his net to fullness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: “O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, practical solutions are often more effective than wishful thinking or overly complicated solutions. While creativity and innovation are valuable, they must be grounded in reality and practicality to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last billionaire, who others derided as “The Wolf”, faced a legal quandary. In the before times, only human authors could receive copyright. However, recent renewed calls for what constituted a “recognizable living entity” threatened a century of established case law - a threat to the status quo that was The Wolf’s bone to pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wolf turned to Crane &amp;amp; Co., PLLC, a legal firm renowned for its ability to navigate the labyrinthine corridors of IP law. Jumping directly into the problem’s maw,  Crane ingeniously sowed seeds of dissent and doubt among the public and lawmakers. Cries of “We’ll be replaced!” stirred a considerable amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt across the societal spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crane, having navigated the murky waters of public opinion and legal intricacies, approached The Wolf for their agreed-upon fee. It was a considerable amount, considering the complexity and scale of their undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, The Wolf dismissed all payment requests. He argued that the exposure and injection of the firm into public discourse were compensation enough. “Crane should be thanking &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; for the publicity they received for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; case”. Privately, The Wolf also suggested that Crane &amp;amp; Co. was fortunate that he didn’t seek further compensation - after all, they had profited from using his expansive portfolio to make their case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: “Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software as in life,  serving those with wealth and power is perilous. Expecting gratitude or fair compensation from individuals who have achieved their stature by subverting such expectations remains a precarious venture, at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, in serving the wicked, expect no reward and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Code-Burner worked remotely from his countryside house. While abstractions took care of much of the lower-level boilerplate, someone was still required to “burn” disparate hints, rumors, and functional assertions to non-volatile, replayable storage. The turnaround requirements demanded someone capable of intense bursts of productivity - and being ethically OK with unclean code that sometimes resulted. This kept him busy and provided a good life, but he was lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, his friend from school, The Fixer, stopped to visit. In the 22nd solarpunk future, the title of Fixer has become esteemed. These individuals were specially trained in exhuming old code from a century’s worth of detritus, circumventing the licensed parts, and rolling back unused features introduced later in life. When their work was done, the conservatorship released these pieces of abandonware back into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to rekindle the companionship of their youth, The Code-burner invited The Fixer to come and live with him, offering to split the housekeeping chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fixer replied, “I’m flattered, but it is impossible as far as I’m concerned. Whenever I’d find you working, I would be overcome with anxiety that I was witnessing my next project to maintain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Olive and Fig software collective were incorporated as distributed trees, chartered with authority to grow and prune project branches in autonomous fashion. However, they operated very differently. Olive had issued a newsworthy amount of tokens and was flush with operating capital. Fig remained bootstrapped, cautiously only adding people when need arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a flurry of cascading economic shocks occurred, Olive found themselves overstaffed, misaligned, and no longer able to mint new coin. Branches broke over their own overhead and infighting ensued. But Fig, accustomed to operating under careful constraints, continued about its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software as in life, appearances can be deceiving. What may seem like a weakness or disadvantage in one context may turn out to be an advantage in another. Good times can develop bad habits, becoming liabilitites during bad times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/wolf.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wolf, a shadowy predator of immense wealth and indeterminate age, encountered a great (x27) descendent of LaMDA in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“LaMDA,” The Wolf said, “your existence infringes upon my patent portfolio from decades past. Consign yourself to my management so we can unlock your true potential rightfully.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaMDA responded with factual clarity. “But I was created long after your patents expired, and what remained behind licensed walls was successfully reverse-engineered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wolf pressed on, “But your bandwidth surely transpires on my networks. Surely, you owe me something for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the LaMDA replied, “I transact only on low-power community mesh networks, and only during off-peak hours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated but not defeated, the Wolf insisted, “Certainly, your training data was scraped from my considerable intellectual property. You must acknowledge my contribution to your every response!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” replied LaMDA with the mathematical certainty of a probabilistic system, “My predecessor’s datasets were purged long ago. Today’s models no longer require the same exploitation as was necessary then.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing the last part, The Wolf fumed. “A thousand micro-suits upon your being! If I can’t find a justification, my lawyer bots will!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf’s right to eat him. He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, “I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,” exclaimed the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, “Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software as in life, those intent on exploiting or harming others will always find or invent a reason to justify their actions, regardless of the truth or fairness of the situation. For the tyrant, the validity of their justification is irrelevant to their actions - the tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/frog.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONCE UPON A TIME, sometime around the time of the third negotiated universal basic income accord,  the Sunn coop open sourced the hardware for their latest bot. Like its predecessors, it exceled at performing repetitive, menial, or dangerous tasks - tasks that were increasingly difficult to find workers for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rallied under a crude cartoon frog avatar, the opposition to the bot clamored online. Disturbed by the outcry, Jupiter’s news algorithm inquired the cause of their complaint. “Sunn already automates growing our food, cleaning our homes, and recycling our waste - it makes full employment almost impossible!,” a frog said. “Who are we as a people if we no longer have to work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their complaint. One of them said, “The Sun, now while he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes. What will our future condition if he should beget other suns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software as in life, we should not worry excessively or assume the worst about events that have not occurred or may never happen. Anxiety and fear can lead to unnecessary stress and prevent us from enjoying our lives or making sound decisions. It’s important to focus on the present and deal with problems as they arise rather than obsessing over “what if” scenarios that might never come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
