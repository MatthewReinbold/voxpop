                <title>Seven Skills to Save Software</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This June, I had the good fortune to present my recent work to several different venues. As I progress in my career, I’m increasingly more interested in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; change happens than the bits and bobs of the change itself. In other words, I started out with a career in technology and have ended up caring a lot more about the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my most recent work, ‘Seven Skills to Change Complex Systems (And Save Your Software)’. A recording of the &lt;em&gt;Deliberate Complexity&lt;/em&gt; delivery is embedded at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold. I am happy to be here. I am also  grateful for the technology that allows us to have these kinds of conversations, regardless of whatever is happening in the world. Today, I will be talking about the seven skills to change complex systems and, subsequently, save your software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To Identify The Barrier to Change, We Need to Rethink Relationships&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the skills, we need to  illustrate the relationships in modern software development. We need to talk about what happens with a change in a complex system and why it seems so hard to facilitate large-scale improvement programs within the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of change am I referring to? When I say improvement program, I refer to a variety of things. This could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Becoming more customer-responsive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving the agile processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing your security posture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever that thing is within your company, chances are you found it was like moving through molasses. Change in a complex system is not just difficult, but new wrinkles seem to constantly emerge, threatening to undo whatever progress has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Once Upon a Time, Software Was Simple&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a gross oversimplification of the way things used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the software a company was responsible for could be modeled as a single unit. This is not a perfect metaphor, but it is useful. In this case, we’ll say that there was a single team working on a single code base, and everybody was working toward the same release date. Everyone celebrated when the “gold master” was published. When it was time to update things, getting everyone moving in the same direction was simple, since there were “of a piece”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve had a firsthand seat to how software creation and distribution have changed. As a Digital Engagement Lead with the Concentrix Catalyst group, I help large enterprises accelerate their API-led digital transformations. I also write about sociotechnical issues on my website, MatthewReinbold.com. Previously, I helped multiple Fortune 500 companies establish software improvement efforts, covering tens-of-thousands of developers across numerous geographical locations and different Lines-of-Business. As a writer for Net API Notes, my email newsletter, I’ve chronicled the changing nature of service interaction for more than seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to peek behind the curtain, I know this model on the screen is not how companies’ internal operations look today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Software Composition Has Changed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where once we might have had a singular monolith - both in concept, team resourcing, deployment, language, framework, and objective - our software capabilities resemble something more akin to abstract art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackkleeman/status/1190354757308862468&quot;&gt;This network traffic map is from a UK company called Monzo&lt;/a&gt;. This was in 2019, so it’s probably more sophisticated now. This graph represents the network traffic between their 1500 different microservices. Rather than having a single monolith, they have 1500 tiny individual pieces that make up the capability that they ultimately deliver to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Monzo is not alone. These ominous charts are called “microservice death stars,” and similar charts exist for Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, and probably – to some degree – the company where you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Today, Software Is Composed of Systems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, you’re not attempting to manage 1500 microservices. But the odds are that the software capability or experience you’re trying to deliver comprises multiple pieces, and for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As software has been challenged to more significant problems, it has become increasingly difficult for any person, or even one team, to comprehend the entire software scope. As a result, we (software practitioners) have increasingly sought reductive techniques for turning a large problem into smaller chunks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile is a reduction in the size of the work unit to be delivered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CI/CD is about reducing the time it takes to deliver through automation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the concept of two-pizza teams is about reducing the scope of ownership to something that isn’t swamped by coordination overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a boon for the individual units and, subsequently, is why the modern enterprise is no longer a single “blob” of software, but a complex, interconnected distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Reductionism Can Lead To Incoherence&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reductionism has been the primary mechanism that we’ve attempted to scale the systems. However, that has led to an interesting side effect: each one of these subsystems potentially becomes uncoordinated from the larger whole. The lack of visibility into other parts of the system, schedule crunch, and comprehension overload cause developers to make decisions optimized for a local scope and often suboptimal for the overall system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each may work toward its local optimized maximum. Examples may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgrading to a new dependency version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to an audit request&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding a feature in response to a customer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleansing data for ML initiative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working on performance improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewriting in the latest framework mentioned on HackerNews because “it looks cool”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We optimize subsystems to the detriment of the entire system all the time. And that becomes its own form of “conceptual debt” for the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Incoherence Penalty Stifles Change&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy, on its own, is insufficient to address the incoherence penalty. For companies to benefit from better, faster decision-making on the part of their autonomous teams – to meet the volume and velocity of critical decisions to be made during a time of change - those decisions need to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hardest part of modern software development has less to do with the technology itself, it has much more to do with maintaining coherence across the parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Nygard is an author and frequent speaker on software development. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2018/01/coherence-penalty-for-humans/&quot;&gt;In a powerful blog post, he defined the “Incoherence Penalty” as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Whatever time the team members spend re-establishing a common view of the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Michael points out, the penalty might be small for a half-dozen people in a single shared workspace or across a half-dozen components. A whiteboard session every week or so is enough to keep everyone aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the effort necessary to maintain alignment grows as we scale and as the system becomes more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For another perspective on this scale challenge, and why it is so difficult to teach at the university level, &lt;a href=&quot;https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2022/04/23/software-engineering-in-the-large-the-coordination-challenge/&quot;&gt;see this great blog post from Lorin Hochstein&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;We Often Model the Architectural Relationships&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complex system, the power is in the relationships between the pieces, the places where these things interact. With dynamic systems, these are the API interfaces. When we diagram these things, it is almost always in terms of technology. We go in hoping to identify a new architecture or tool that will provide the silver bullet to the incoherence problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;However, We Often Leave Human Systems Vague or Undefined&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what is missing from these diagrams are the interactions between humans. In creating change, we shouldn’t ignore a significant source of the relationships in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if we’re going to save software, if we’re going to create change in modern development environments, we need to be able to create coherence. And to create coherence, that means applying skills to the human relationships equally, if not more, than the energy we expend on the software integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This Is Unfortunate, As Tech Doesn&apos;t Create Alignment; People Do&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology does not create alignment - people do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy and alignment are not opposing ends of a spectrum but complimentary. The more alignment you have, the more autonomy can be supported, assured that the decisions made will move the organization in the same direction, not pull it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to be successful, here are, rapid-fire, seven skills essential to addressing the human system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There Are Seven Skills For Extending Influence Over a Complex System&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about each of these, comprehensively, could be an entire talk on its own. What I will attempt to do is introduce the concept in the time we have left, reference some powerful places to get started for further exploration, and we’ll go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crafting a Compelling Vision&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an idea for how something could be better is not the same as having a compelling vision. If all success needed was a good idea, then my domain name registrations would have made me rich long ago. It takes work to go from an idea of what to do to a vision that rallies other to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@pavement_special&quot;&gt;Riccardo Annandale&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/7e2pe9wjL9M&quot;&gt;Unsplash &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Start at the End: What Are You Celebrating?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, Agendashift, author and Agile coach Mike Burrows lays out a formal process for creating a compelling vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He starts with the concept of this celebration. So perhaps in my organization, I might say, “&lt;em&gt;I wish we had every API on the same gateway, rather than everyone punching holes through the firewall with their own redundant infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;”. Going through this exercise, called the celebration, we need to reframe that because, in my head, I’ve already picked a solution. I’ve already said, “&lt;em&gt;I want this external vendor and I want everybody to be on it&lt;/em&gt;”. But that’s not an outcome. In terms of the business value to be delivered, it’s already assuming a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following this exercise, called the celebration, we proceed to answer the “5 questions that start with ‘W’” – who, what, when, where, and why. When I’m doing is I’m unpacking, this preconceived notion of everybody on a single vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Recast Obstacles As Outcomes, Not Absences&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike also defines this other exercise called the 15-minute FOTO, which is also incredibly adept at reframing, but this time reframing obstacles to outcomes. What obstacles keep us from getting to this wonderful celebration? Well, this obstacle that I’m writing down, more likely than not, is in the form of an absence. So, for example, I might say one of our organizational problems is that we don’t have meaningful postmortems. That’s an absence of something. And again, that absence assumes a solution; it assumes that postmortems should be done, but it doesn’t necessarily define the outcomes we’re trying to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recasting obstacles in this way can have two significant benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It encourages you to be specific (perhaps the request for postmoterms has nothing to do with learning, but rather an individual wishing closure, a milestone, after a significant effort)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoids describing the problem only in terms of the absence of some prematurely defined solution (there may be other prompts or activities to re-incorporate learnings other than a postmortem event)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, maybe the reason that somebody is suggesting postmortems is not that they want to incorporate learnings. Perhaps they wish they had a more definitive milestone. When a project is done, maybe there’s a backlog that seems endless. A postmortems would act, in this case, as a milestone, as a means of recognizing achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in reframing things you go beyond obstacles to discover what people value. That true value is at the heart of a compelling vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Vision Comprises More Than Just An Idea&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have what you’re trying to accomplish in terms of outcomes, you can go ahead and create your compelling vision. Your vision should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-clear-articulation-of-the-current-state&quot;&gt;A Clear Articulation of the Current State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transition story will highlight how the past way of doing things is unsustainable and how it has led to the current crisis; a crisis which requires new ideas (your ideas!) to overcome. The articulation must explain why the change should happen now. As I work with companies, we spend a lot of time here. Sometimes the source of urgency is obvious: things like a pending bankruptcy or a public security breach are in the driver’s seat. But, often, your idea must confront a suboptimal, yet functional, status quo. The key is creating a sense of urgency, not panic, about why the change must happen now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-attractive-future&quot;&gt;An Attractive Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story must emphasize that the future is not a fixed, predetermined point but something that can be changed. We can’t predict the future, but we can try to invent one with more desirable outcomes. If instituting a change is worth doing, we must have a coherent story about the new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-identity-for-participants&quot;&gt;A New Identity for Participants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System change requires working in new configurations, often with new (to you) people. Stepping beyond the comfort zone of our friends and colleagues means engaging with strangers and opponents who may not have a shared understanding. A story should enable people to recognize their shared interdependence in the system, thus creating a shared identity. It must show how the sub-optimal future cannot be solved by individual stakeholders alone and how a new network with new relationships can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-path-connecting-it-together&quot;&gt;A Path Connecting It Together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, a story must point people toward needed change. Part of this includes articulating what progress along the path looks and feels like.
A vital aspect of a story is how it links current actions to the desired future destination. Connecting these things increases the understanding of our responsibility and agency within a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/09/10/CreatingCompellingStories/&quot;&gt;I’ve written an example arguing for remote work elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Coalition Building&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major change is challenging to accomplish. No one individual, no matter how charismatic, can develop the perfect vision, communicate it to everyone, eliminate all obstacles, perform all the experiments, and tally all the short-term wins. What is needed is a coalition able to shoulder the load and recruit new help as the effort grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most critical aspects of coalition building is that &lt;strong&gt;you’re attempting inclusion, not assimilation&lt;/strong&gt;. A coalition should elevate the participating members’ unique skills, experiences, and desires. A sense of belonging is essential to sustaining a movement through difficult times. This means that members should still feel uniquely valued. They’re going to be bringing their ideas, assumptions, experiences, and preferences. A sign of a healthy coalition is if the vision is evolving, changing, and adapting because of the participation of new individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@jasongoodman_youxventures&quot;&gt;Jason Goodman&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/6awfTPLGaCE&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Create Onramps For All Interests And Abilities&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just a handful of activities for involving people in your coalition-building. Your call to action can be much more diverse than “please read this blog post” or “attend our office hours”. Those, in a vacuum, are not that compelling. People have a variety of different availabilities, talents, and inclinations. In building your coalition, create inclusion points or on-ramps that can accommodate that variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;More Fearless Change&lt;/em&gt; is not like a regular book; you don’t read it from beginning to end. Instead, like a cookbook, it includes numerous recipes for things to try. They start from very simple like “attend this lunch-n-learn” and escalate to holding an internal developer conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Move From Mobilizing To Organizing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not be able to launch an internal developer conference at the beginning of your change effort. But the critical thing is accommodating and allowing for people to engage with your effort as they are able. And once you start doing that, you need to start thinking about moving people from mobilizing to organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transactional mobilizing&lt;/strong&gt; is a relatively straightforward concept– people offer to help, and you give them a task to do. This is the kind of low-effort “Retweet if you agree” campaigning on social media. While that may be easy to do, the actual, long-lasting impact is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformational organizing&lt;/strong&gt; is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying, recruiting, and developing other people with whom we share purpose to form a collective identity for the change distinct from their previous role&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growing a group of people that recognize and express responsibility to each other (if they had to pay dues, would they still belong)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transforming the resources of that group into the power needed to make and sustain change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many folks are happy to help if it doesn’t cost them time, energy, budget, or resources. A significant task of coalition building is moving people who are already concerned about the issue to those willing to do something, even at a cost to themselves. Organizing deepens participants’ understanding of who they are and why they want to make the change. In doing so, they then identify others who share their values and recruit to continue building change momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4_nFUX6Z2Q&quot;&gt;check out this video from Hahrie Han on the difference between Mobilizing and Organizing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Communicating&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously, that includes a lot of communication. When I say communication, I don’t mean standing on the top of your building with a bullhorn and yelling your awesome idea at people. When it comes to change, people don’t need a good talking to – to make a change, they need a good listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be more successful, efficient, and capable in their roles. However, as important is retaining their autonomy. Just ordering people to do something, even if it is in their best interest, rarely works. For example, I absolutely understand that I should eat healthier but still bristle whenever my wife brings it up. If communicating comes across as a command or a mandate, it will most likely create resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle&quot;&gt;Brooke Cagle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/g1Kr4Ozfoac&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Evoke The Reasons For Change They Already Have&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of our daily conversation is a default activity: it just happens. By contrast, strategic conversations deliberately use limited time and attention with another person to achieve a specific goal. In our case, it is about furthering our change initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivational interviewing&lt;/strong&gt; is a conversation technique designed to strengthen personal motivation and commitment to a specific goal. It does this by eliciting and exploring a person’s values and beliefs within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than charging into a forum to say, “Hey everybody, listen to my idea,” motivational interviewing starts with asking open questions to find out more about the person:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why did they join the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is it about the company that they enjoy?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the recent accomplishments that they’re proud of?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do they find challenging?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through that listening, you’ll get an understanding of the things that they value. You can then affirm the strengths of their beliefs system that align with the kind of change you’re trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflective listening underscores the individual is being listened to; not everything needs to be rephrased or repeated. Much of the exchange should be those things that support or bolster already existing attitudes or beliefs that align with the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, summarize. Connect the dots between the things that they already believe and want to accomplish in their own careers with the things you are trying to make happen within the organization. Create that alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bakadesuyo.com/2022/05/get-people-to-change/&quot;&gt;A more detailed description of the usefulness of motivational interview is available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional perspective on having strategic conversations with potentially resistant people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2021/03/persuading-the-unpersuadable&quot;&gt;see the article “Persuading the Unpersuadable by Adam Grant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide21.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bring Schwag And End With A Call To Action&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, during these conversations, bring schwag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of my laptop. And as you can see, I’ve been part of a few efforts. What is important to remember is that the more abstract the change effort, the more helpful it is to have a physical manifestation. It doesn’t have to be just stickers. Challenge coins, pins, posters, t-shirts, or polos are all valid. What you pick ultimately depends on the culture and what kind of currencies are exchanged. But bottom line, have something representing the mission that can extend and communicate change after you are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the conversation, and with your swag, end with a call to action. If you study this image, you might notice that few of these images even have a link where people might go to find out more. Ultimately, you don’t want to miss an opportunity to connect people with one of your carefully crafted coalition on-ramps created in step 2. Invite people to the next step on their journey as part of your communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experimenting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make change possible, we likely need to understand more about what is required – we need to adapt and adjust based on what we learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, we think great change requires atomic, massive events that stand out like a fork in the road – at Amazon, they refer to these as “one-way doors”. And as you might imagine, trying to do that huge thing will generate a proportional amount of resistance. However, a powerful skill is shrinking the change being asked for, running several simultaneous experiments, and then leveraging the learnings to make the change more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, during our vision creation in step 1, we’ve reframed our obstacles and we’re looking for outcomes. We know that there might be a host of things we might do to deliver and achieve that outcome. From the coalition we’re assembling in step 2, we might have people in a position to try different things and report back. This is where we engage them to run experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Small Experiments Equate To Less Resistance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experimentation skill is how we engage those groups, gather the results and continue to create a flywheel of exciting revelations that subsequently inform more experiments, getting us closer to our ideal state. Small experiments equal less resistance. We always need to understand and consider how we make an experiment safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an experiment is too big to fail, it’s no longer an experiment. And that becomes very, very, very scary for your leadership team to rally behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/why-experiment-1169339b2ddc&quot;&gt;More from John Cutler and the importance of experiments here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide24.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experiments Create Short Term Wins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of things make a good experiment? Good experiments are :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unambiguous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clearly relate to the change effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-953-some-mvp-and-experiment-tips&quot;&gt;For a host of additional considerations when running experiments, I again refer you to John Cutler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide25.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Celebrating&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our experiments begin generating results, we need to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m not talking toga parties, or gender reveal events. When done strategically in a business context, celebration is a skill to help further influence a complex system to align behind the change you seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t have a plan for celebrating accomplishments. Moreover, the past 2-and-a-half-years of remote work and pandemic isolation has meant that regular notice and elevation of good work has been much more difficult. That is a problem because celebration is a significant opportunity to &lt;strong&gt;cement the lessons learned&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strengthen the relationships between people that make future achievement more plausible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change and growth are promoted through positive emotions more than through disciplined practice&lt;/strong&gt;. Celebrating small wins produced by our experimentation reinforces the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide26.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Leverage Your Company&apos;s Internal Recognition Pyramid&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the accomplishments we celebrate don’t have to be large, our celebrations don’t have to be grandiose; they just need to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company of decent size has an internal kudos or recognition program. There might be that yearly dinner with the CEO for the people nominated and selected for extraordinary effort. This formal type of program is at the top of the pyramid. And while those are nice, they only impact between 1% and 10% of the employees at any given company, and they do so infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the informal programs where you can give people kudos or send a gift card. That might be monthly or quarterly (if people remember). Perhaps that gets between a third and half of employees. A $50 gift card to Amazon is nice, but it still isn’t the kind of continuous reinforcement we need to see for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in the sincere, daily detailed word of thanks to a person illustrating the desired behavior. When done correctly, these expressions of gratitude become their currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday recognition is about expressing thanks to people and acknowledging others for doing fantastic work in distinctive ways. It should be weekly, if not daily, and can impact 80-100% of employees, if done correctly. While formal, “big” recognition activities may be appropriate for significant milestones, it is the regular, persistent reinforcement that can have 2 to 3 times greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous roles, I had calendar time blocked out once a week to express gratitude. In some cases, this might have been a note to people that had presented an above-average API description. Other times, it might have been someone that asked a great question during a group event. Sometimes, it might have been a team that had their big launch. Regardless of what it was,  I made sure that I spent some time reflecting the positive qualities they exhibited and connecting how their success was related to the change underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, like most corporate kudos systems, their manager also saw these messages. Managers are busy. They’re usually grateful for any additional signals to help them triangulate where their team is and how they’re doing. What makes these nudges valuable is that they’re scarce– we take it for granted that people know how they’re doing. Taking the time to create something “official”, that persists as part of the employee’s work history, creates a currency that can be paid out during performance reviews and quarterly sync-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in more on authentic recognition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://authenticrecognition.com/where-should-i-focus-my-time-on-improving-recognition-at-work/&quot;&gt;there’s more available elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide27.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There Are Several Ways To Frame Success&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting, it may be challenging to find ways not to feel like a broken record, repeatedly telling people “good job”. The encouragement that is delivered needs to be authentic. Furthermore, some people respond differently to different types of feedback. Some like feedback about their own performance. Others react more strongly to a favorable comparison with their peers. Others prefer to hear good news despite disappointing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework is from Dr. BJ Fogg’s book, Tiny Habits. It is not meant as a checklist, but as a handful of examples when framing encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide28.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Empowering Others&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical momentum is lost whenever you let up before the job is done. Regression may follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In successful transformation, the guiding coalition uses the credibility afforded by the short-term wins to push forward faster, tackling even more or more extensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@heylagostechie&quot;&gt;Mars Sector-6&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/IgUR1iX0mqM&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide29.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Different People React To Change Differently&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incumbent to realize that not everybody embraces change to the same degree. This illustration is of the innovation distribution curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curve illustrates that within any population, you have the following distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Innovators (2.5%): Will something for no other reason than it is new&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early Adopters (13.5%): More discrete in their selections than innovators, adopters use status as early pioneers to maintain social credibility with their peer group while taking on less risk (cutting versus bleeding edge)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early Majority (34%): Willing to adopt innovations, but only after seeing what success with the innovation looks like among their peers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Late Majority (34%): Are reluctant to adopt the innovation unless specifically told they have to, after which they require higher levels of support and encouragement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laggards (16%): Those who actively resist change and will actively work to thwart an innovation for no other reason than it is new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide30.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Different People Require Different Resources&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that I point this out is that different people will require other support. A mistake would be to treat all those necessary to change as a single, monolithic group. To best support them, it is vital to recognize where they are in their journey and meet them where they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide31.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Terraforming the Culture&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New practices, if they are to continue beyond the effort of the guiding coalition, need to grow deep roots. Without them, the existing cultural norms will reassert themselves when the transformation program or initiative stops working day and night. Shallow roots require constant watering. Without the attention, the practices dry up, wither, and die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the new practices made in a transformation effort are not compatible with the relevant cultures, they will always be subject to regression. Changes in a workgroup, a line of business, or even an entire company can come undone, even after years of effort, because the new approaches haven’t been anchored firmly in-group norms and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the final stage in changing complex systems is terraforming the culture to make change last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide32.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Inverse Conway Maneuvers Are Hard In Practice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the last step in influencing a complex system to align behind a change, I want to touch on culture briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with the API space, you’re probably familiar with the concept of Conway’s Law. You may also be familiar with the Reverse or Inverse Conway Maneuver. In the Inverse Conway Maneuver, the idea is that redesign your organizational structure to produce the kind of software that you want. It is a powerful idea, but having lived through my share of enterprise re-orgs, I can definitively say this is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;I’ve written about the impacts of Conway’s Law on software design before&lt;/a&gt;. For coverage of the &lt;em&gt;nuance&lt;/em&gt; required for successful Inverse Conway Maneuvers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnetapinotes.substack.com/p/net-api-notes-for-2022-06-07-issue-199&quot;&gt;check out this recent edition of my newsletter, Net API Notes #199&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide33.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Plant The Change In Operations, Processes, and Rewards&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a seed of an idea to grow, it must be firmly planted in the company’s culture. This means that it is part of the ongoing activities. That could mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People with experience with the idea are explicitly sought as part of the hiring process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The importance of the change is specially highlighted as part of employee onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstration of the change is part of the reward performance structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason that this is step 7. While some steps, like coalition building, communication, and experimentation should be done simultaneously, changing cultural norms should only be attempted when sufficient momentum is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide34.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Next Steps&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to end with a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This second - think about something in your current work you wish (or needs) to be better. This shouldn’t be hard - nothing is perfect and we’re not trying to prioritize here - that can be done later. What’s the first thing that comes to mind?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today - whether it is through Slack, Microsoft teams, an email, or your corporate HR feedback system, send a note of gratitude to someone that you’ve seen handle the problem well. “Hey Tim, I just wanted to let you know I was really impressed with how you keep the test suite current. That takes care and consideration I don’t always see. Thank you.” The goal here is not to solve all the things for all the time - the goal here is to begin a practice of reinforcing positive behaviors.
Create a recurring task to do this on a regular basis. And make sure the feedback is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week - schedule a chat - over lunch, if you’re back in the office, or a casual “sync” with someone who might feel the same way. Explore what they might have tried and what the results were. And ask if they are aware of others to have further conversations with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably won’t be able to enact the entirety of your change immediately. But you will have taken the important first steps of acknowledging the &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; system at play. You started down the path of creating greater alignment and, in doing so, begun to bridge the fragmentation that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/06/Slide35.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Better Bits - A Book To Expand On These Ideas&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had mentioned that there was so much more that could be said for each skill. I also strongly believe that successfully learning these skills is essential for us to navigate not just our complex software systems, but life itself. That’s why I’m writing a book called &lt;strong&gt;Better Bits&lt;/strong&gt;. If these topics are of interest to you, &lt;a href=&quot;betterbits.substack.com&quot;&gt;sign up for updates at betterbits.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Software Pipelines As Behavioral Prompts</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/06/25/ArchitectureIsLaw/&quot;&gt;previously discussed how important the environment is in creating meaningful behavioral change&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/07/16/GithubCopilot/&quot;&gt;also suggested that the developer’s IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) was an influential source of positive behavioral prompting&lt;/a&gt;. If we move beyond just the single IDE, the software development pipeline could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be an environment capable of prompting desirable outcomes. This process is known as &lt;strong&gt;The Golden Path&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charity Majors is the co-founder and CTO of Honeycomb, makers of code observability software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://charity.wtf/tag/scaling/&quot;&gt;She describes the Golden Path like so&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Tell all your engineers that going forward, the Golden Path will be fully supported by the org.  Upgrades, patches, security fixes; backups, monitoring, build pipeline; deploy tooling, artifact versioning, development environment, even tier 1 on call support.  Pave the path with gold.  Nobody HAS to use these components … but if they don’t, they’re on their own.  They will have to support it themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all but the smallest of dev shops, there are advantages to having centralized processes and infrastructure. “Approved” tech stacks are standard to ensure proper staffing and triage is possible. A single log standard can save copious amounts of time and effort when in the thick of an outage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, governance - either in the form of an Architectural Review Board, Center of Excellence, or some other bureaucratic entity - dictates the software development behaviors they expect others to follow. An example might be “We are a Spring Boot and Node shop” or “Every new service must implement Open Tracing”. The bulk of energy is then expended on detection and enforcement, which - honestly - is probably not how anybody dreamed they’d be spending their productive waking hours. (The lack of of career development path for this work is a topic for another post; all too many enterprises end up parking their most passionate system thinkers into these professional cul-de-sacs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, employing a Golden Path strategy directs that energy to create a superior developer experience. Sure, each team that needs to make an API &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; select, configure, and operate their own API gateway. They &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; roll their own authentication and key provisioning server. They &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; customize their own CI/CD pipeline. But if there is a platform team providing a well-supported, consistently performant,  and feature-compatible equivalent, why would they? And some point, the novelty of tinkering with configuration files wears off, and a realization sets in: dithering with non-differentiating technology is not the same as delivering business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a Golden Path is work. However, suppose you can create an environment where doing the right thing is the easy thing. In that case, you are significantly further along than relying on best faith efforts and goosing external incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022/golden-path.png#wide&quot; alt=&quot;A trail through fall trees in northern Colorado. &quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2022-05-05&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these same lines is Yunong Xiao’s 2017 presentation entitled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/06/paved-paas-netflix/&quot;&gt;The Paved PaaS to Microservices at Netflix&lt;/a&gt;”. “Paved Path” is the same concept as “Golden Path”.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>&quot;Just Tell Me What To Do&quot;</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.acast.com/s/ctrlaltdelete/falling-out-of-love-with-the-internet-disconnected-audiobook&quot;&gt;In a recent edition of the Ctrl Alt Delete podcast&lt;/a&gt;, host Emma Gannon described her discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/290368045246716/&quot;&gt;a Facebook group that helps individuals make small decisions&lt;/a&gt;. “Can’t decide between two shirts?” it asks. “Can’t choose pizza or spaghetti for dinner? Let this group make small decisions for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “the before times”, I would have no use for a group like this. However, in the pandemic times, there are simply some evenings where this sort of “outsourcing of the banal” seems attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/11/22/StandardsAsAccelerant/&quot;&gt;I wrote about decision fatigue before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Decision fatigue, or when the mind becomes exhausted after a sustained period of decision making, often follows. Many became acutely aware of decision fatigue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Suddenly, even trivial activities like opening doors and touching elevator buttons were a puzzle. Not only had the number of decisions skyrocketed, but the heavier impact that those decisions carried (the possibility of illness or death) created outsized effects: stress, loss of energy, and lowered mental capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last several years have been stressful. When individuals weren’t navigating a pandemic, they were experiencing everything from political unrest to supply chain bottlenecks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/10/1085792118/americans-stress-is-spiking-over-inflation-war-in-ukraine-survey-finds&quot;&gt;And then there was a war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses dealing with API sprawl are also stressed. The unprecedented events have meant that software architects, already stretched thin, have experienced higher levels of decision fatigue.  “&lt;strong&gt;Just tell me what to do&lt;/strong&gt;” is a common request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-software-strategic-impact&quot;&gt;The Software Strategic Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understandable how individuals would desire to bypass the hurly-burly of defining first principles - those are yet more decisions! “If it is good enough for Stripe or Twilio”, the thinking goes, “it is good enough for us- we don’t have energy for that vision quest stuff; there’s too much to do!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my concern is what happens on &lt;em&gt;Day-2&lt;/em&gt; with this “made to order” approach to API standards. “&lt;strong&gt;Day-2&lt;/strong&gt;” is a DevOps term. It relates to the challenges that arise not from changes to a specific application but the more significant abstract processes and operations. For API standards, Day-2 problems relate to how a set of design standards, architectural guidance, or run-books get disseminated, adopted, and improved upon over time. It is one thing to gather key leaders together to announce expectations for a newly established API program. It is another thing entirely to continue to drive engagement and improvement among stakeholders in month 6. Without creating the crucible to form first principles, this greater identity and shared purpose aren’t formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, without discussion, adopting standards developed elsewhere may lead to bloated and ill-fitting style guides. Every standard a developer must follow introduces a grain of cognitive friction. Sometimes, the price paid is worth the production-environment benefit. However, every organization is different, with its own experience, style maturity, expertise, market, and desired end goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each requirement in a standards doc should be able to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the better API outcome created by this standard?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are we willing to sacrifice (stop doing) to make this standard possible?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will “better” manifest in our day-to-day activities, behaviors, and interactions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will we know if the standard is working?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has anyone done this before?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are we inviting others to a better future or imposing a singular vision of a future onto others?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the non-obvious implication of this standard?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Bonus) How will we automate the education and enforcement of this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without considering the above questions, adopting standards from a different context will (best case) result in unnecessary effort and (worst case) be ignored. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalyst.concentrix.com/&quot;&gt;consulting practice I work for&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of incorporating this nuance through careful, considered conversations. Together, we arrive at a healthier place for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-news&quot;&gt;The Good News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Cutler is a product management expert and frequent communicator. He also sees the stress among the change agents he works with. Through that work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-46b52-7-lessons-for-sustainable&quot;&gt;he also shares some hope&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the last eight months, I have spent countless hours speaking with change agents. They reach out to me for product management advice, but these conversations inevitably seem to turn to the topic of how to nudge their organizations in new directions. During the pandemic these discussions have acquired a new sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Their anxiety is palpable.  They care for their teams but are overwhelmed by the challenges, and the opportunities, facing them.  To be sure, the pandemic has been catastrophic on every level, but many of the change agents I have spoken to are finally receiving the support they need and bringing about the impact they have long wanted to see. Their work is paying off, at the most inopportune time. There is movement in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these unprecedented times, we must recognize the inherent opportunity in the status quo fracturing. Introducing change now does not have to contend with bursting people’s “normal” bubble. Nothing is normal! &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F&quot;&gt;The cheese has already been moved&lt;/a&gt;. Energy is available if someone dares to channel it. That is not to say that change, like defining a set of API standards for a sprawling and increasingly problematic ecosystem, is easy. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, it does mean people are more likely to accept something new.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Standards as Accelerant</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/11/willy-wonka-rules-of-the-house.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An animated GIF of Willy Wonka stating &apos;Sorry, rules of the house.&apos;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When debating IT governance structures, people make lots of claims. One is that decentralized governance “maximizes” team freedom. Or, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Increased standardization decreases the freedom for teams and people to innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/11/01/PolarityMappingAndAPIGovernance/&quot;&gt;I argue in my piece on the usefulness of polarity maps&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t treat IT governance as a false dichotomy or “centralized versus decentralized”.  There is a spectrum of implementations that can blend positive aspects from both sides. Standards and guidelines tactics can help focus and direct work in productive directions &lt;em&gt;when used correctly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision-fatigue-happens-when-too-many-decisions-are-delegated-to-the-lowest-level&quot;&gt;Decision Fatigue Happens When Too Many Decisions Are Delegated To The Lowest Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; is when an individual or group has difficulty taking action because the solution space is too large (also called “analysis paralysis”). &lt;strong&gt;Decision fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, or when the mind becomes exhausted after a sustained period of decision making, often follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many became acutely aware of decision fatigue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Suddenly, even trivial activities like opening doors and touching elevator buttons were a puzzle. Not only had the number of decisions skyrocketed, but the heavier impact that those decisions carried (the possibility of illness or death) created outsized effects: stress, loss of energy, and lowered mental capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, attempting to make decisions on rapidly shifting data impedes speed and confidence. It is reasonable that pandemic guidelines would change to reflect new information. However, the early lack of a single, centralized message and delegation to local authorities (many of whom were ill-equipped to be making epidemiolocal judgments) created a cacophony of competing, sometimes contradictory, guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar conditions exist in IT environments where &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; decision-making authority has been deferred to individuals or small teams. It is challenging to “be innovative” under such circumstances. Encouraging folks to “just make better decisions” will not create the desired outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;standards-free-focus-for-what-matters&quot;&gt;Standards Free Focus For What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear, concise standards serve as guide rails that steer limited bandwidth toward productive activity. Rather than debating how to express pagination for the thousandth time, teams can adopt a pre-existing company style, thus diverting their energy toward creating unique business value. Instead of wrestling with the decisions involved in understanding and coding around another bespoke datetime format, internal API producers could accelerate delivery by uniformly adopting a widely known standard, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601&quot;&gt;ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all implements in the governance toolkit, standards, guidelines, and rules can be misused. However, when applied appropriately, clear policy and regulation can reduce decision fatigue and free teams’ time and energy for more meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Pandemic-Led Digital Transformation; You&apos;re Doing it Wrong</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic impacted businesses in many ways, some obvious (hello, work-from-home) and some so subtle that they may not even be apparent for several more years. One aspect pointed to in business and technology press is how the pandemic “sped up” digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How true that statement is depends to large degree with how you define digital transformation. I was recently asked for my thoughts on the matter and I thought I’d also share them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;was-the-pandemic-a-catalyst-for-digital-transformation-or-do-you-think-most-companies-missed-the-chance-to-drive-their-digital-transformation-initiatives-forward&quot;&gt;Was the pandemic a catalyst for digital transformation? Or do you think most companies missed the chance to drive their digital transformation initiatives forward?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is hard, even under the best of conditions. We often see a change in moments of crisis (takeovers, bankruptcy, or public scandal) when the call-to-action is finally loud enough to overcome people’s comfort with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic (and ensuing intertwined crises including supply chain disruption, political upheaval, and social unrest) provided plenty of impetus to change. However, companies need to assess whether what changed is simply doing the same thing as before, but over video and instant messaging? Or did they embrace the situation to introduce new norms, processes, and products to their business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the same thing as before, but more efficiently, is called &lt;em&gt;digitization&lt;/em&gt;. It &lt;strong&gt;was not&lt;/strong&gt; a digital transformation. At the beginning of the pandemic, I can’t fault leaders for this response; they did the best they could to maintain any semblance of “normal” even in the most adverse conditions-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-even if that meant attempting rituals that were a poor fit for this new reality. A cringe-worthy example was the rash of post-pandemic “virtual happy hours”. The attempts to connect came from a place of good-intentions: replicate the after-hours get together to foster a sense of team. People assumed they’d do the same thing as before but BYOB over Zoom with everyone working from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than being something to look forward to, these become loathsome, dreary affairs that only reminded people of how weird and isolated the pandemic made all of us. After a day filled with imperfect video meetings, the last thing most people wish for is more time at their makeshift desk, glued to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation requires examining these things that used to work, identifying what was valuable, and imbuing those properties in forms better adapted for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-you-advise-companies-to-take-on-digital-transformation-in-2022&quot;&gt;How would you advise companies to take on digital transformation in 2022?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into 2022, we have a better sense that there will not be an exact return to pre-pandemic “business-as-usual”. Leaders need to stop thinking about Band-Aids and temporary fixes while waiting to return to the way things were before. Instead, leaders need to take a hard look at which parts of their business fared better than others. Which areas were ill-suited to the rapid, consistent change? And how vital is fixing those areas before the next shock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital business design is the holistic organizational configuration of people (roles, accountabilities, structures, and skills), processes (workflows, routines, procedures), &lt;strong&gt;and then&lt;/strong&gt; technology (infrastructure and applications). Someone somewhere is experimenting with providing employees with meaning, connection, and advancement in these necessary new ways. That person can either be at your company or employed by a disruptive rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are your experiments? How do you measure whether the new ways, made possible by digital technology, are better than the old ways? How are you discovering new, uninterruptible ways of delivering business value? If companies haven’t thought about or answered these questions, now is the time to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 2021-11-12&lt;/em&gt;
While wargaming likely 2022 API scenerios, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2022/&quot;&gt;this 2022 set of predictions from Forrester&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Business leaders are grappling with big employee-related questions right now. When (or if) to return to the office environment and how? We predict that only 10% of firms will shift to a fully remote model, and 30% will go back to a fully in-office model. The remaining 60% of firms will shift to a hybrid model, and one-third of those firms will fail in their first attempt at anywhere work. Why? &lt;em&gt;Because shifting to a hybrid model while still designing meetings, job roles, and promotion opportunities around face-to-face experiences will send productivity plummeting and lead execs to question the model instead of the processes they cling to.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have not only the opportunity, but the imagination to create new forms. A return to “business-as-normal” is a strategic mirage.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Why is there no &apos;Correct&apos; API Lifecycle?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my colleagues in the Postman Open Technologies Program and I were discussing API lifecycles. It quickly became apparent that we each had our own mental models for what was (and *most certainly &lt;strong&gt;was not&lt;/strong&gt; *) worthy of inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of search results hints that the industry has as many opinions about what constitutes an API lifecycle as we had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/feature/5-stages-of-an-API-lifecycle-explained&quot;&gt;TechTarget has a five-step lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;: plan, dev, test, deploy, retire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apigee.com/about/cp/api-lifecycle-management&quot;&gt;Apigee promotes an 8-step version&lt;/a&gt;: design, develop, secure, publish, scale, monitor, analyze, monetize&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.axway.com/amplify-products/api-management/api-lifecycle-management&quot;&gt;Axway lists three steps&lt;/a&gt; (with many, many substeps): creation, control, consumption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/what-is-api-lifecycle-management/&quot;&gt;SmartBear mentions 5&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; five than TechTarget: planning and designing, developing, testing, deploying, retiring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mulesoft.com/webinars/api/full-lifecycle-api-management-anypoint-platform&quot;&gt;Mulesoft mentions 4&lt;/a&gt;: design, implementation, security, management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/25/full-api-lifecycle-management-a-primer&quot;&gt;Redhat features a confusing conjoined set of circles&lt;/a&gt;, and 13(!) kitchen-sink steps: strategy, design, mock, test, implement, deploy, secure, manage, discover, develop, consume, monitor, monetize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process that evolved during my time as Capital One’s Center of Excellence Director skewed heavily to the needs of a large, mature, and internal system. As a result, our API lifecycle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made no mention of monetization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasized discrete team ownership and end-of-life elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hand-waved past development requires as code creation had its process, controls, and oversite group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process that resonated for us, eventually, was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt;: Has someone already solved this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define&lt;/strong&gt;: Who will own the work at a team and LOB level, what access models will be in place, what SLAs need to be met, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Engage with stakeholders, make an OpenAPI representation, get feedback, iterate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop&lt;/strong&gt;: Code the thing (subject to many, many other criteria outside the API group)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprecate&lt;/strong&gt;: Plan for ending or superseding with a subsequent version; includes communication plan, timeline expectations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; Define what info sticks around for historical purposes while ensuring any executables, access tokens, and gateway routing is removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why all the variation? Why isn’t there a “right” or “correct” API lifecycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the variation is largely because lifecycles are created within companies to generate particular outcomes. Nobody installs a lifecycle for the sake of having more to train and enforce. If sloppy design leads to losses in a competitive marketplace, a company should have an explicit “design” step in its lifecycle to drive better outcomes. If security has been a mish-mash, a dedicated “security” step should be elevated as part of a lifecycle process to prompt more focus on correcting that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monitoring company is sure to list monitoring as part of its lifecycle. A company that sells documentation software will also elevate documentation to a high-level concern. It will depend on the vendor, but whatever their product excels at will probably be part of whatever lifecycle they promote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With companies looking at instituting a lifecycle, I’d &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; find the burning problem that would benefit from additional learning, creativity, and focus. That would be the first touchstone called out in the path between an idea’s inception and production runtime. I’d then continue to build up and out from there. Dropping an entire thirteen-step lifecycle where none previously existed isn’t just introducing a massive amount of disruption all at once - it also summons &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/09/22/OvercomingChangeResistance/&quot;&gt;a proportional amount of resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Finding API Governance Balance With Polarity Mapping</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of my most rewarding conversations in my professional career are when I coach folks on their emerging API governance needs. A common myth is that companies &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; settle for one extreme decision-making structure or the other regarding governance. Either they grant API teams full autonomy and suffer from the fragmentation and associated overhead it brings. Or they gain alignment and consistency through centralized oversight and heavy bureaucratic processes while losing innovation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, anything done to an extreme can create negative consequences. However, in my experience, too many companies only see a total commitment to one position or another as their only option. What companies need, in reality, is a blending of the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we find the Goldilocks (the “just right”) amount of governance? With a &lt;em&gt;polarity map&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reintroducing-the-polarity-map&quot;&gt;(Re)Introducing the Polarity Map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/11/polarity-map-template-full.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 1: An Empty Polarity Map; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamboard.google.com/d/1H4Vj1I6SlgWUPUPCgfzqZIKBIrKNlARG9WJe5xXO180/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve Made A Google Jamboard Template Available&lt;/a&gt; based on the example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxmastery.com/the-joys-of-polarity-mapping/&quot;&gt;UXMastery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ruthmalan.com/Bredemeyer/Org_Dynamics_Masterclass_Overview.htm&quot;&gt;Ruth Malan’s Organizational Design Masterclass&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to polarity mapping. A polarity map recognizes there are benefits and unintended consequences with each extreme. It encourages participants to describe these in detail. Once we’ve identified benefits, we then discuss activities to achieve these desirable traits in our system. After that, we can define a series of measurable indicators. The purpose of these metrics is to signal when we’ve overcorrected and risk unbalancing the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might use polarity maps for a variety of “versus” articles popular software architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build versus Buy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microservice versus Monolithic Architectures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synchronous versus Asynchronous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Batch versus Real-Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing versus Debugging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API-Design First versus API-Code First&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tabs versus Spaces (joking, kinda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polarity maps help explain a phenomenon I observed in previous roles: the “pendulum effect”. If we begin to fill in the map according to the “decentralized versus centralized” API governance, as I described in the beginning, the map looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/11/pm-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 2: A Beginning Polarity Map for Centralized Versus Decentralized Governance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organizations start API governance in the upper left of the quadrant, “decentralized”: individual API teams have nearly total decision-making autonomy. While this is efficient initially, the problems with this model become more apparent as the size of the API ecosystem grows. The map represents this change with the downward arrow leading to the lower left quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the negatives accrue, support for the opposite pole, or “centralization”, grows. The organization seeks the benefits of the upper right quadrant. This change works, for a while, until the overcorrection creates its adverse effects. If we continue to follow the arrow’s path, we end up in the lower right area. When the downsides reach a critical mass, the organization moves back toward decentralized decision-making and repeats the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting both extremes on a single plot, we can demonstrate benefits to both sides. Moreover, in establishing the oscillation between sides, we can make a case that adopting one or the other is not an argument to be won but a set of properties to balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-a-sample-map&quot;&gt;Getting Started With A Sample Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the process, let’s walk through an example polarity map that shows what many burgeoning API ecosystems struggle with: *do we promote &lt;strong&gt;centralized&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;decentralized&lt;/strong&gt; API management?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doing a polarity map, it is essential to remember that each will be different; every company has unique needs, people, goals, and available resources that impact what is listed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/YMMV#English&quot;&gt;YMMV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, based on my own experience, a set of benefits and unintended consequences for both sides might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/11/pm-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 3: An API Governance Polarity Map With Example Benefits and Unintended Consequences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-action-steps-and-early-warnings&quot;&gt;Defining Action Steps and Early Warnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/em&gt; is a significant first step. Talking through effects and their placement on the map is beneficial for building organizational or API leadership team alignment. Where things get truly useful is going to the next level and identifying &lt;strong&gt;action steps&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;early warnings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/11/pm-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 4: A Polarity Map with Action Steps and Early Warnings Added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Steps&lt;/strong&gt; are how we will gain or maintain the positive results from focusing on a given pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warnings&lt;/strong&gt; are quantifiable indicators to signal when a system is straying into the downside of a pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to take actions to promote the positive aspects of centralization (the upper right: “visibility”, “predictability”, “consistency”, etc.). Action may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documenting API standard operating procedures (including, but not limited to, style guides, production environment readiness requirements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adr.github.io/&quot;&gt;architectural decision records for changes&lt;/a&gt;, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating compensation or recognition structures for teams demonstrating API excellence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forging communication channels to both promote the best work as well as solicit feedback for further refinement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early warnings for the centralized side of the map may be more challenging to define but not impossible. There could be a problem if there’s a growing clamor of teams waiting on the centralized group for a decision, or a noticeable uptick in meetings to reconcile a tricky edge case. Identify which areas are of most concern for your organization, identify how to quantify changes, and continue to iterate until you have something actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left side is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polarities&lt;/strong&gt; involve two equally valid and necessary points of view or truths. Despite how we usually think of them, polarities are interdependent pairs that need each other to maintain and gain performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A polarity map is a tool that API leaders can use to  understand where they are in the system and accentuate positive aspects of both worlds. When it comes to API ecosystems, polarity maps suggest that centralized or decentralized decision-making is not final governance destinations but part of a whole to be managed.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Title slide for the deck.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you for being here. I hope you’re healthy and you’re safe, and those that you care about are secure as well. We’ll get through this. I’m sure of it, and someday we will see each other again in person. However, until then, thank goodness we have these kinds of arrangements to share and continue to learn from one another in some form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation is entitled “We wrote an API description, now what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_02.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, OpenAPI has become the way to capture and share API intent and function. In API-Design-First shops, the creation of an OpenAPI description is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after you’ve created this machine-parsable description, what is next? How do you get the most significant amount of ROI for the time and energy you invested in it? How are others using their OpenAPI artifacts beyond just documentation? And how do you get started? I’ll answer those questions and more in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_03.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold, and I am Postman’s Director of API Ecosystems and Digital Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Postman, I’m a member of the Open Technologies Program. Our mission is to improve API practice, education, and research for companies of all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I also write a weekly API email newsletter. The amount of API-related things published on the web can be overwhelming; Net API Notes started as my attempt to filter the signal from noise - it just turned out that the persistent act of sense-making was valuable to others as well. It also prepares me for conversations like the one we’ll have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_04.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, though, let’s establish a few things. I’m not going to cover the history of how OpenAPI and AsyncAPI became nearly the defacto API specifications. There are plenty of other talks covering that ground in greater detail - some at this very conference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do want to clarify how I will use a couple phrases of throughout this presentation. If you use these words differently in your day-to-day work, that is completely fine. For this presentation, however, when I say &lt;strong&gt;API Specification&lt;/strong&gt;, I refer to the specific documented, syntactical requirements an API designer writes to. Examples of API specifications include OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about an &lt;strong&gt;API Definition&lt;/strong&gt;, I refer to the JSON or YAML document that captures your unique API’s business intent, written to meet a specification requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, when I talk about an API specification, I talk about what a standards body writes. When I talk about an API definition, I am talking about what you write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also - in this presentation, I will be sharing or referencing numerous links. If you are interested in those links and don’t want to wait until this presentation is published on my website, go over Twitter and look up the username libel_vox, shown in the footer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox/status/1442929462685757441&quot;&gt;All the links are in a Tweet pinned to my profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_05.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by rewinding the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guido of Arezzo (ur-EH-zoe) was a Benedictine monk living in Italy at the turn of the millennium before last, around 1000 AD. And Guido had a standardized notation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, the pinnacle of popular music was liturgical chants. People went crazy for them. But as Guido visited churches, he noticed how much younger singers struggled to learn the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was common to have parchments with the words and some occasional squiggles that suggested the performer move their voice higher or lower. However, there was no representation of pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: original uploader was Robbot at Dutch Wikipedia. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1621845*&quot;&gt;Transferred from nl.wikipedia to Commons., Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_06.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution, Guido reasoned, was to invent a means that would allow someone to sing along even if they had never heard the music before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Guido invented the staff. With fixed notes and a specification for conveying them, young students could “better detect the level of pitch”, as Guido wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People new to APIs also have trouble getting started. And API documentation is usually the first thing people think of when they think of what to do with an API description. Unfortunately, that’s often where it ends, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image on the slide is a grossly simplified development process, but one that is all too common. In it, a bunch of work is done to create a thing and, when it is ready to “go live”, some documentation is made for “the customer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong - documentation made this way is better than a random PDF or CMS entry - both of those are akin to non-uniform random squiggles Guido’s students previously had. There are many places where you can insert an OpenAPI description and get out some beautifully rendered documentation, either for your dev portal or for sharing with a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, documenting at the end means that the context and nuance of why something is the way it is has to be recreated and reassembled. Because of this, things get left out. The API description, when treated this way, becomes lipstick on a pig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re composing music, one doesn’t wait until the entire song is done before writing something down. In the same way, we need to think about API descriptions as not something that comes at the end but a means at the center of creating a better result in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_08.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standardized representation of intent, or an API description, can be used for more than documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we start treating our API description as our central source of truth about the API, rather than an afterthought or “nice-to-have” documentation, a whole host of options open up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this presentation, I am going to detail four areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code Generation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I’m going to extrapolate a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_09.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about code generation. If you have an API description, whether yours or an API you wish to consume, you are well on your way to having code generated for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of client code generators available. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator&quot;&gt;Open-API generator&lt;/a&gt; supports an incredible number of programming languages. I had to make the type super, super tiny on this slide to fit them all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that generators won’t write everything. However, getting the tedious, non-differentiated boilerplate out of the way through generation is a huge time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_11.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it isn’t just client code! You can also stub out a server implementation if you have an OpenAPI description of how an API works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the slide, I have a picture of Postman’s interface. I’ve loaded an OpenAPI 3.0 description. Next to the YAML syntax, I have a button that allows me to create the beginnings of my server code with just a couple of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers include Go (Chi), NodeJS (Express), Java (JAX-RS), and Python (Flask). That is a compelling way to kickstart new development and the next logical step with what we can do with these API descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_12.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to generate SDKs from OpenAPI descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with SDKs is finding the team bandwidth to keep feature parity across multiple languages, especially during rapid change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plaid.com/blog/adopting-the-openapi-schema-to-generate-plaids-sdks&quot;&gt;Plaid has a fantastic case study&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they automatically keep a broad suite of beneficial SDKs in sync and up to date from their OpenAPI sources of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_13.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just code that we can generate. Let’s take it to the next level and talk about generating code to test code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_14.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing an API is one of the most important things to do. However, not all testing is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of this pyramid of testing needs, we need to make sure our response payload is as expected; making sure that when we make a request we get the response we intended in the shape expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, we have chaining HTTP calls. Once we know that one request works the way we assume, we start using it in conjunction with other calls as part of more advanced workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving upwards, we have data-driven requests. This level is where we take our static requests and begin to change the data provided. In doing so, we being discovering the rough edges and uncovering assumptions about ongoing usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the top are negative tests and error flows. In other words, at this level we’re purposely stepping off the “happy path” and evaluating how gracefully the API fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the top of the pyramid, we have contract testing. Testing at this level is no longer about the API we’re creating but verifying the consistent behavior of other APIs we might be dependent on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many pyramids, every level is sized in approximate proportion to how much effort should be expended. So, for example, companies should spend a large amount of effort verifying that the response payloads are structured correctly or at the bottommost level before moving upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, where people should put the bulk of their effort also happens to be some of the most tedious work. Therefore, it is a no-brainer that we leverage an API description to provide the necessary coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://netapinotes.substack.com/p/net-api-notes-for-2021-08-04-issue-170&quot;&gt;This version of the API testing pyramid inspired by the test pyramid featured in Net API Notes Issue 170&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_15.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A valid OpenAPI document inside Postman can be used to create test cases to be run across multiple endpoints. Or you can customize on a per-endpoint basis. Like code generation, generating tests free brain cycles on solving higher-level, more challenging problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That generation is possible because we have a standardized notation that conveys our intent even if we haven’t seen the API before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_16.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get really interesting when we take that code and tests that we previously created and connect it to automation. We are now able to aggregate and monitor a complex system. We can “see” not just individual APIs for the trees they are. Instead, monitoring whole collections of APIs gives us a sense of the larger forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_17.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Postman’s founder, Abhinav, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.postman.com/new-postman-api-platform-redefining-api-management-for-api-first-world/&quot;&gt;shared a vision of the API platform landscape&lt;/a&gt;. And there are many companies in that view that perform what we call API monitoring: using a remote computer to send requests to an API on a scheduled basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ensuring that an API is running or not is the same thing we were doing a decade ago. It is important, but it also scratches the surface of the complex automation possible with API descriptions and some simple bridge code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_18.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are familiar with the website, If-This-Then-That (IFTTT). With API descriptions, creating workflows via the Postman monitor is nearly as easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the purpose of the Postman Open Technology Program is to elevate API practice across all industries. As you might imagine, that entails a lot of writing. Rather than just using a monitor to tell me whether services I care about are up or down, I created a workflow to prompt me to complete my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used an OpenAPI description to create a call to my cloud-hosted markdown editor. That gets me the words I’ve written so far daily. I put together some logic to not worry about weekends because the worst thing is stress-inducing notifications during recovery time. Finally, I merged that with the results from another OpenAPI description that gets and parses US holidays - again, alarms aren’t going off when I am recuperating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does require a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; more work than dragging lines between colorful chicklets (Rest In Peace, Yahoo! Pipes!). However, if you have standardized service representation, exciting workflow automation is at your fingertips. We’ve gone beyond just testing APIs to creating &lt;strong&gt;low-code solutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s empowering for the people in your organizations who may not be full-blown developers but still want to take advantage of information and services already available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_19.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API journey doesn’t start with a cast of thousands. For most companies, their first API began as a targeted means to a specific business end. Scaling architectures, processes, training, and tooling was far from the minds of all involved at the onset, as it should be - a town doesn’t build its public works department when there are only a few homesteads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with more people creating APIs more experiences, architectural styles, and bespoke infrastructure are introduced into the growing API ecosystem. In the absence of repeatable processes, preferred techniques, or uniform tooling, the results from API production will become unpredictable - coordination costs across unaligned pockets of practice increase along with inefficiency. Higher-order alignment suffers. As described in the book Accelerate, “teams become adrift, concentrated on micro-optimizations disconnected from aligned business delivery”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody needs to be concerned with those higher-order concerns and the health of the ecosystem. Many might assume that necessitates a cumbersome, gatekeeping API review. However, with API descriptions, there are several lightweight, helpful things we can do to encourage alignment while maintaining team autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_20.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create consistency in approaches, many companies create API style guides. But just having a proposal of what people should do is not enough. Just because something is written down does not mean it will be interpreted and presented in an API description the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the slide, in gray, I have an example suggestion for pagination that you might find in a style guide. It encourages the developer to use the words “limit” and “offset” when giving callers the ability to page through a collection of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may seem straightforward. However, what happens in practice is something akin to what appears on the left side of the slide, in purple. Yes, the author included the words “limit” and “offset”. But the articulation of how these two keywords are used is still vague. As a caller of this API, we may assume that both are numeric values with some certainty. However, several questions remain. Is there a maximum value for “limit”? Is offset 0-indexed? What is the default page size?  Are these values to be passed only as query params, or do they also work as header values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API description on the left meets the letter of the law, but not the spirit; this API’s user has to spend additional time and energy to figure out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should we berate an API designer, especially one new to the company, for not magically including all the additional verbiage of the right-hand example? OF COURSE NOT!  “Just knowing” is hard. The style guide should make doing the right thing easy! Rather than leaving the right thing up to interpretation, the style guide should provide the desired YAML or JSON representations for anyone to copy and paste into their designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds straightforward because it is! Creating meaningful templates and snippets that solve everyday problems creates alignment because you’ve made doing the right thing easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/08/18/OneWayToImproveAPIGuidance/&quot;&gt;I’m written more about these approaches on my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_21.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, several tools can parse an API description and nudge practice to a healthier place. Using tools in this way is a much healthier practice than manual reviews, where suddenly it is a contest of will over who is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of API validators. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openapi.tools/&quot;&gt;OpenAPI.tools&lt;/a&gt;, the picture on the left, does a fantastic job of categorizing many of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermade.org.uk/openapi-converter&quot;&gt;OpenAPI Converter&lt;/a&gt; can also take an API description in a variety of formats. Both can be used to ensure an API description adherence to expectations, thus avoiding fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_22.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security is a pressing issue at the moment. As I’m showing here in the slide, the tool is warning the API author that not only are they not providing any authorization for these endpoints, but the entirety of communication is happening over unsecured HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to see tooling get more opinionated. Thus better supporting API designers with insights when it is most beneficial - while they are designing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_23.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a quick run through four areas - code gen, testing, monitoring, and governance that can benefit today from a description-centric approach. But let’s go even further. What happens when entire industries can sing from the same songbook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_24.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csHOifygBA0&quot;&gt;I love this story that Jean Yang, founder and CEO of Akita software, shared recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Akita software was to help developers make sense of their complex distributed systems. They began to approach the problem in a systems way and briefly considered integration with open telemetry or maybe integrate with a service mesh like Envoy. The problem was that there had been no standardization; not everybody uses a service mesh, and when they do, it isn’t always Envoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akita realized that APIs provided a standardized point that was uniformly consistent across all providers, architectures, and languages. Because services had adopted this common lingua franca, they were able to build a new set of observations and insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_25.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stedi.com/&quot;&gt;a company called Stedi is doing some fantastic things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDI, or Electronic Data Interchange, has been around since the 1970s. It attempts to standardize the exchange of business information, like purchase orders and invoices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stedi applies modern approaches to schema validation, like JSON schema, to EDI. In the process, a whole suite of modern tooling can be leveraged for working with legacy formats; unlocking new value and opportunities in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_26.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, back to this guy - back to Guido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the centuries since Guido invented standardized musical notation, there were many additions. First there was duration. Then barlines, stylized clefs, dynamic markings, ties, and slurs were added. These changes supported a growing number of instruments and vocal styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music grew beyond liturgical chants. The Renaissance era, where music tended to remain on a single tempo for the duration of the piece, gave way to the Baroque period, one marked by increased composition creativity. Baroque also established the opera, concerto, and sonata as musical genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expansion didn’t happen in isolation. It is no coincidence that this creativity occurred when people had a greater ability to capture and share their intent. The development of a standardized notation, a specification, allowed composers to cross-pollinate, enrich, and evolve each others’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_27.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unless you’re a music nerd, that may be trivia. Let’s make this less abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help students remember his new standard, Guido also invented something else you might be familiar with; a mnemonic that helps people remember the steps between tones on his staff. You probably know it: do-re-mi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That mnemonic is featured prominently in the 1965 film Sound of Music. That film, and the von Trapp children within, was seen by millions - including my wife and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a Gretl, but I have a Greta. I also have a Liesel. Guido, in 1000 AD, wouldn’t know what a movie was, let alone comprehend his influence on it. Furthermore, he couldn’t conceive how a standard representation would ultimately influence my daughters’ names. &lt;em&gt;But it did&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swagger, the predecessor of the OpenAPI specification, came out in 2010, a little more than a decade ago! It’s not even a teenager yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergence from complex systems is an unpredictable thing. Our APIs ecosystems are complex systems. Who knows what future will emerge from the API descriptions that we create and share today? Whatever it is, I can’t wait to see what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_28.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your time. If you want to get ahold of me, you can go to my website. You can also check out my email newsletter, and I’m pretty responsive on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/10/ASC 2021 - Wrote an API Description, Now What_29.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Overcoming Change Resistance</title>

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got an excellent idea for your organization. You’ve spent time &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/09/10/CreatingCompellingStories/&quot;&gt;carefully crafting your story&lt;/a&gt; and begin to share it. Then something begins to happen; perhaps there isn’t anything as dramatic as a slammed door or “NO” screamed in all caps. But there’s a hesitation, an avoidance, or an ongoing series of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism&quot;&gt;whataboutism&lt;/a&gt;” that increasingly frustrates and drains energy. Congratulations, change agent! You’ve met &lt;strong&gt;resistance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplace changes are &lt;em&gt;sociotechnical&lt;/em&gt;, or having both a technical and a social aspect. The technical change part is the mechanics of how a task is performed. There might be technical detail and nuance to be debated. However, what is a far more significant source of resistance is the social aspect of the change. &lt;em&gt;Social&lt;/em&gt; refers to how those affected by the change believe it will &lt;em&gt;alter their organizational relationships&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change, even wholesome, necessary, and positive, can provoke a sense of loss in individuals. Sometimes this sense of loss is legitimate, like when a company closes down its “innovation hub” or no longer recognizes “Quality Assurance (QA)” as distinct from the engineering job family. In other situations, the change is perceived as a loss of dominance, control, power, and/or a sense of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People react to loss in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resisting-change&quot;&gt;Resisting Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case, they dig in and close down. Those resisting demand what is lost be returned. &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/09/10/CreatingCompellingStories/&quot;&gt;Without a recognized, new identity for the participants&lt;/a&gt;, our change narrative induces a counter-narrative: an energetic incitement to &lt;em&gt;return to the way things were&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1969/01/how-to-deal-with-resistance-to-change&quot;&gt;As this classic 1969 Harvard Business Review article by American sociologist Paul R. Lawrence states&lt;/a&gt;, resistance manifests as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“persistent reduction in output, an increase in the number of “quits” and requests for transfer, chronic quarrels, sullen hostility, wildcat or slowdown strikes, and, of course, the expression of a lot of pseudological reasons why the change will not work. Even the more petty forms of this resistance can be troublesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response is so typical that many executives assume resistance to anything is inevitable. Yet, changes must occur for businesses to thrive. This doubly for the all-important “little” changes that constantly take place: changes in work methods, in routine office procedures, in the location of a machine or a desk, in personnel assignments and job titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You never want a perfectly fit, coherent, and therefore stable system (therein lies stasis and death)… for a system to evolve and thereby persist over time requires a certain (unspecified!) resilience more so than stability.” – Alicia Juarrero&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opening-oneself-and-others-to-change&quot;&gt;Opening Oneself (And Others) To Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; way people might respond is to &lt;strong&gt;open up&lt;/strong&gt;. This opening requires a shared assumption that there is something new here and that we will find our way into that newness together. What does that mean, practically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to getting buy-in to a change is when those affected by it are co-creators. While this participation may sound simple in theory, in practice, it does entail careful handling. Participation &lt;em&gt;is a feeling on the part of people&lt;/em&gt;, a belief that their needs are being heard and concerns addressed. Participation &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; inviting people to comment or attend a meeting and checking the box ‘done’. Employees must be treated as having treasured insight and opinions rather than a target to be pumped for carefully calculated questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the identity piece of our storytelling is so critical. A future vision they can relate to, and the relationships it entails, will mitigate the sense of social loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-api-governance-example&quot;&gt;An API Governance Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies grow, the complexity introduced due to fragmented API design approaches and ad-hoc, laissez-faire governance drowns any benefit the API ecosystem had while new. In this state, integrations take longer, meetings go up, and estimates get more untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, leadership may move to establish one of any number of groups: Centers of Excellence, Design Guilds, Architectural Review Board, or API Champions. The expectation is that these specialists are inserted between the “doers” and the production environment. Their job is to ensure that designs are “done right”, mitigating the mishmash (and related overhead) that the organization increasingly toils under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach, if done unilaterally, is that leadership has introduced not only a technical change - the specific THOU SHALL and THOU SHALL NOT that moves an architectural style from &lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;prescriptive&lt;/em&gt;. They have also changed an API developer’s relationship with the organization by inserting an oversite group in the pipeline. The usual work relationships, not just between developers and their peers, but developers and their environments, were changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I discussed above, changing the social relationships nets more than just “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F&quot;&gt;who moved my cheese&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftrain.com/wwic&quot;&gt;why wasn’t I consulted&lt;/a&gt;” whinging. The sense of loss breeds resentment, resentment creates low morale, and the quality and alignment initiative meets resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the idea to decrease fragmentation and improve design cohesion was a bad one! What it means, instead, is that a different approach is needed. Rather than a top-down directive that changes the entire organization’s working relationships, the affected parts of the organization should be invited to co-create the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes &lt;em&gt;listening first, talking second&lt;/em&gt;. It could be that not everyone agrees on what the problem &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. If people are given a chance to come up with ideas, discuss the ideas of others, or otherwise be involved in the process, they’ll become invested in the change and understand it better. It is also easier to build a future inclusive identity in your narrative if those people were involved in defining that identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change has both a technical and a social aspect. The technical aspect of change is about making a measurable modification in the job’s routines or practices. Change’s social aspect refers to the way those affected by change think it will alter relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can get better about addressing the social needs of people during change, we will better positioned for long term success. Again, from the 1969 article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The significance of these research findings, from management’s point of view, is that executives and staff experts need not expertness in using the devices of participation but a real understanding, in depth and detail, of the specific social arrangements that will be sustained or threatened by the change or by the way in which it is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies come and go. But people remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Creating Compelling Stories</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/09/hermes-rocket-typewriter.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of my Hermes Rocket typewriter.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2021/09/03/PlausiblePromises/&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about the importance of creating a &lt;em&gt;plausible promise&lt;/em&gt; for system change. To briefly recap, a plausible promise must be (1) inspiring enough to attract others to participate and (2) stand a believable shot of happening given all other constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens when a change agent needs more than the elevator pitch? How does one move from a plausible promise to a compelling change narrative? The answer is &lt;em&gt;crafting a compelling story for systems change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-stories&quot;&gt;Why Stories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is for more than just screenwriters and teenagers past curfew. Stories are how we articulate the world, our place in it, and &lt;em&gt;the ability to change&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re all-in on the cloud” and “We’re an agile shop” are both story excerpts companies retell to shorthand how their technical work should be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories, particularly those repeated within organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appeal to our emotions, moving us to act in a way that dry, dispassionate analysis fails to (“I empathize with your pain.”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify the complexity of the unknown unknows into a logical, repeatable set of causal relationships (“I now have words for what was just a gut feeling.”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make abstract phenomenon tangible and thus changeable (“I can get my arms around it.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change begins when one of the existing stories begins to fail. This faltering could be due to scaling challenges, a strategic pivot, or marketplace disruption. Whatever the reason, the old narratives no longer work or seem incomplete given increased business complexity. When this happens, it is time to tell new stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parts-of-a-motivating-story&quot;&gt;Parts of a Motivating Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask five aspiring authors what makes a good story, and you’ll get six answers, two podcast recommendations, and the odd existential crisis. When it comes to systems change, however, the components are well known. To inspire change, a story must have the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Clear Articulation of the Current State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Attractive Future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A New Identity For Participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Path Connecting It All Together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-clear-articulation-of-the-current-state&quot;&gt;A Clear Articulation of the Current State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context frames and gives meaning to the change that must take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story of transition will highlight how the past way of doing things is unsustainable, how it has lead to the current crisis, which requires new ideas (your ideas!) to overcome. It is important that that articulation explains why the change should happen &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-attractive-future&quot;&gt;An Attractive Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When people are holding on tightly to the past, it’s because there is something they value and they have no idea of what might be valuable in the future.” - Esther Derby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During disruption, past data is a poor predictor of a future state. Faced with uncertainty, people often take what they know about the past, combine it with their assumptions and emotional state, and project it on to the future, largely unconsciously. Deconstructing a group’s assumptions and projections about the future requires careful analysis. If we can identify which beliefs are steadfast and which are loosely held, we can navigate this potential minefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story must emphasize that the future is not a fixed, predetermined point but something that can be changed. We can’t predict the future, but we can try to invent one with more desirable outcomes. If instituting a change is worth doing, we have to have a coherent story about the new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-identity-for-participants&quot;&gt;A New Identity For Participants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System change requires working in new configurations, often with new (to you) people. Stepping beyond the comfort zone of our friends and colleagues means engaging with strangers and opponents who may not have a shared understanding. A story should enable people to recognize their shared interdependence in the system, thus creating a shared identity. It must show how the sub-optimal future cannot be solved by individual stakeholders alone and how a new network with new relationships can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, creating change &lt;em&gt;may not&lt;/em&gt; require everyone. It does, however, need to connect the people that need connecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-path-connecting-it-together&quot;&gt;A Path Connecting It Together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, a story must point people in the direction of needed change. Part of this includes articulation of what progress along the path looks and feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vital aspect of a story is how it links current actions to the desired future destination. Connecting these things increases the understanding of our responsibility and agency within a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path storytelling should emphasize more positive than negative. Change spurred by intrinsic motivation is more sustainable, or those internalized stories rooted in people’s strengths, aspirations, and ability to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-remote-work-example&quot;&gt;A Remote Work Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take what we’ve learned above and apply it to an area many businesses are currently wrestling with: remote work. Let’s assume that you’ve stumbled through the past eighteen months, but you’re looking for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articulate the current state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remote work has been around for some time. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of individuals were thrust into remote work situations not by choice but by necessity. Some companies were able to cope better than others. More than a year and with multiple variants continuing to spread, leaders are challenged to go from merely surviving to thriving. Talented individuals have come to expect remote options. Companies that insist on co-location at some unknown point in the future limit themselves to whatever expertise happens to be within a geographical area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craft the attractive future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to move beyond thinking about remote work as a temporary band-aid. Moving office ritual and routine to a Zoom meeting is not enough (“virtual happy hours”, for example). Instead, we need to truly digitize the work, not just work digitally. Learning to do this effectively taps our organization into the best, brightest, and most diverse talent wherever they are in the world. It also positions our org for a future where adaptation and iteration will be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a new identity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Getting there will require new management techniques. Communication is always a vital skill. But we must learn how to go beyond lowest-common denominator transactional interactions encouraged by digital tools to relational ones. Our managers and leaders need to be able to check-in with our employees, building trust and psychological safety, not just checking-up on WIP. If our managers can demonstrate the more significant empathic requirements of remote management, our people will deliver greater value while enjoying increased flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Path To Connect It All Together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to revise our operating procedures, training focus, and performance review characteristics to get to that future. There is precedent: Gitlab, a company with a $6 billion valuation, has no physical headquarters and employees in nearly 70 countries. Automattic, makers of WordPress and operators of Tumblr, employs almost 1700 remote employees. By learning from their examples to prioritize the appropriate digital investments, we will embrace the sort of change that is more &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/10/what-it-takes-to-lead-through-an-era-of-exponential-change&quot;&gt;perpetual, pervasive, and exponential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just a generic example. If you were to do this for your organization, this remote story would need to be customized to speak to the unique needs, incentives, and fears that exist. Begin sharing a version of your account with those you trust to give you constructive criticism. Then iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A plausible narrative has immense power. Much more than mere evidence or data.” - Bob Marshall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories are critical for creating systems change and can be told by anyone. If we better understand the elements that go into a story, our messages will find more traction faster. Moving beyond a plausible promise to a full-blown change narrative takes work. However, if your idea is a good one, the results are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
