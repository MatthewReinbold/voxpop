    <description>This is the website for Matthew Reinbold, the Director for Capital One's   Platform Services Center of Excellence. I also write the 'Net API Notes' email  newsletter and curate NetAPI.events. Much of what appears here dated prior to 2017 was  previously published at VoxPop.co and VoxPopDesign.com. There's also a bit  of legacy detritus from older experiments like mutednoise.com,  miltiantgeek.com, codeaway.org, etc. Adult fan of Lego. And trying to make Dakota Gothic a thing.

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to share that, this April, I’ll be joining Postman as the &lt;strong&gt;Director for API Platforms and Digital Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;.  I’ll be reporting to Kin Lane, Chief API Evangelist. I’m the latest addition to Postman’s Open Technologies group, an incredible, assembled group of industry-leading professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postman.com/&quot;&gt;Postman, as many developers already know, sets the bar for API collaboration excellence&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll get to help companies build their API lifecycle management and governance programs on that incredible bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m excited to get started and look forward to meeting all my future fellow &lt;em&gt;Postmanauts&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m eager to look forward, I would be remiss to not say a few words about the past. Thank you to those at Capital One for an incredibly educational five and a half years. I’m proud of so much of that early, ecosystem-enabling work. That effort has scaled to thousands of schema-defined, affordance-consistent microservices that perform &lt;em&gt;half a billion requests a day&lt;/em&gt;. From training to the collaborations, from tool development to analysis, every day was an opportunity to grow as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half-decade is also long enough to see initial assumptions grow, change, and take on a life of their own. Relationships form and strongly held ideals evolve beyond the first contact with production. I have a different level of professional maturity now that I didn’t have at the start, even if the past year has mostly been unkempt hair and sweatshirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remain a vast number of folks there continuing to create positive change. I see you, salute you, and want you to know I will continue to root for you. I also wish my former team the best of luck; you have taught me a tremendous amount. Now the wheel is yours. You’re driving where things go next. You’ve got this. I believe in you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a busy next few months. In 2015, my family moved to the East Coast for the Capital One job. The pandemic and limited travel options impressed just how removed the northern Virginia region is from our extended families. So we’ll be taking advantage of Postman’s 100% remote allowance and moving our circus to the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of &lt;strong&gt;uff-da&lt;/strong&gt; for now, but we’ll break &lt;strong&gt;lefse&lt;/strong&gt; soon enough. &lt;strong&gt;Skol&lt;/strong&gt; and boldness to you, friends!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WandaVision and This American Moment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/02/wandavision.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;WandaVision, now streaming on Disney+&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to talk about WandaVision, the Disney+ series, and the first entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Four&quot;&gt;Phase Four&lt;/a&gt;. After more than a year and a half, the team behind the series could have easily coasted on pent-up fan demand and character nostalgia. Yet, through some meticulous design decisions and serendipitous timing, WandaVision is uniquely commenting on this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social and class unrest, political skullduggery, disrupted workplaces, chaotic education situations, and economic uncertainty are all playing out amid a global pandemic. We’re at home; a move that began as a preventative measure but, increasingly, feels like a prison. Since there’s little else to do or little else we have the cognitive and emotional energy for, I’ve been watching more television than usual. Like many, I’ve binged past comfort shows while doomscrolling through insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time moves strangely in the pandemic’s unreality. One day drags along in repetitive tedium like any other. Yet the months rapidly disappear with little memory to account that they were there. Without personal touchstones - the trips, reviews, concerts, and even new media releases- I’ve become a character stuck in my own show’s reruns, repeating the routine but unable to progress the character arc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;light spoilers to follow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In WandaVision, the residents of Westview, NJ, also find themselves trapped in an unnatural reality. They are compelled, sometimes at great pain, to maintain a facade of the American dream: the suburb, the marriage, the homeownership, the stupefying white-collar job, etc. Even the town name, ‘Westview’ is a nod to western, or American, perception of success. The aspirational normalcy is an attempt to cope. And, at the end of the episode, the characters avoid the strangeness unpinning it all by watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I watch WandaVision, I see a reflection of ourselves; protagonists struggling with grief. We are unsure of how this started or when it will end. We’re in control but, not? We are grieving for those we lost. We grieve for the time we won’t get back and the plans deferred. We grieve for the myths we told ourselves about a just nation and a logical, ordered world. Wanda’s story is one of grief. Despite the superpowers, her story is eminently relatable to our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;is a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Some of us have yet to acknowledge what has happened. Some of us continue to cling, even violently, to the narratives we once had. Processing the world as it is and what has changed will continue for us for some time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would WandaVision resonate so strongly if we weren’t in a pandemic? Perhaps. I could write another post on how the show uses TV tropes and audience expectations to accentuate the storytelling. That “meta-ness” would be entertaining in any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, WandaVision becomes transcendent at this moment in which we’re all trapped in our own Westview.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why AI Success is API Built</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I gave two public presentations. I posted ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2020/07/09/APIsAreArrangementsOfPower/&quot;&gt;APIs are Arrangements of Power&lt;/a&gt;’ previously. The clean-up on the second, delievered when in-person gatherings still happened, languished due to (&lt;em&gt;gestures wildly at the surrounding air&lt;/em&gt;) things. During the holidays, however, I made an effort to finalize and pull everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recording of an abridged version of the talk is embedded at the bottom. A portion of the talk even made it into the book, &lt;em&gt;Accelerating Software Quality&lt;/em&gt;, by Eran Kinsbruner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here is ‘Why AI Success is API Built’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/strong&gt; My name is Matthew Reinbold, and tonight, I will be talking about &lt;em&gt;Why AI Success is Built on APIs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re briefly going to go over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why AI is such a big deal &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; just to level set&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about the challenges of creating AI models&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why some of those challenges lead to APIs to deliver AI functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Why is Matthew giving this talk?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m passionate about these issues because they impact my work. I am the Director of the Capital One API and Event Streaming Center of Excellence. It is a unique position that requires me to be part enterprise architect, part business analyst, and part internal developer evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I work with our 9000+ developer community to ensure that the message-passing systems built exhibit consistency and cohesion. We provide training, collaborate on API descriptions, evolve oversight processes, and facilitate co-creation on our design standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also do a fair amount in the broader API community. I write a newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;http://netapinotes.com/&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;. I curate &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapi.events/&quot;&gt;Net API Events&lt;/a&gt;, a list of in-person events for API professionals worldwide. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox&quot;&gt;tweet a fair amount, mostly about APIs but sometimes, occasionally, Lego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also make some legally dubious laptop sticker parodies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/matthewreinbold&quot;&gt;for my Patreons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Getting on the Same AI Page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that I first establish what I’m talking about when I talk about when I say ‘AI’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Clarifying AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has generated almost as much excitement as clickbait headlines. You would be forgiven to think that we’re all one errant compile away from Skynet. I mean, even the Pope is talking with Microsoft. When something crosses over into popular awareness, it is significant; even if that awareness is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, we should be on the same page. AI is a broad brush that paints many things. Usually, when you see these alarmist articles about Skynet and Terminator death robots, the authors are postulating about “&lt;strong&gt;Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;”. This is software that can “think” in a manner we associate with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still quite far from that future. What I will be talking about tonight is much more narrowly focused. So narrow, in fact, that practitioners refer to it as “&lt;strong&gt;narrow AI&lt;/strong&gt;”. Even more specifically, I will discuss a popular technique, often conflated as AI, called “&lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has real, tangible benefits for companies. It also solves interesting challenges. As an additional plus, it &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; won’t end human life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Growing at a Tremendous Rate&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were trying to follow every single new paper released in the machine learning space, you’d now be trying to absorb 100 machine learning papers &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt;. While the concepts behind machine learning have been around for some time, the current Cambrian explosion of published work has many factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moore’s Law&lt;/strong&gt; - The &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; of compute is faster than it has ever been, particularly in GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Compute&lt;/strong&gt; - Everyone can get access to these fast processors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Data&lt;/strong&gt; - For better or for worse, we are better about to scale both data collection, storage, and analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater Ease in Model Creation&lt;/strong&gt; - More people are trying more stuff more of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Chart from the blog post ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://data-mining.philippe-fournier-viger.com/too-many-machine-learning-papers/&quot;&gt;Too Many Machine Learning Papers&lt;/a&gt;’)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;What is Machine Learning?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full explanation of how machine learning, and how its various permutations work is beyond this presentation’s scope. However, as we begin to discuss why these things take so much compute or why they’re so energy expensive, we need some theoretical model in how they’re composed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for example, we had to create a service that could determine whether a provided picture was of a chihuahua or not. The output is either “yes” if a chihuahua is present or “no” if not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, we would create several &lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt; for our &lt;em&gt;input layer&lt;/em&gt;. Each of these nodes corresponds with an individual pixel of the image provided. A &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; is assigned to each of the nodes. The value of this weight is based on how important that node, or individual pixel, is to determining whether a chihuahua is present. Pixels framing the outside might have a low weighted value, while those around the inverted triangle comprising the two eyes and snout would be worth more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, I think it is important to note we’re already dealing with some large numbers with only our input layer. My first digital camera was a Sony Mavica in 1999. The &lt;em&gt;max&lt;/em&gt; resolution of a picture saved to the floppy drive was 640x480. If we were processing images in that resolution, we’d have &lt;strong&gt;an input layer of 307,200 nodes&lt;/strong&gt;. Those are 307,200 weights that need to be tuned to develop a model. And as you might imagine, pictures taken with modern mobile devices have millions of pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we’re only getting started. We take the RGB values in a given node, compute a result with the weight for that node, and then pass that value &lt;em&gt;to every other node in the subsequent layer to be processed&lt;/em&gt;. There may be many of these “hidden layers” between the input and the output. Each node in each layer mathematically computes its result. This continues until all the results are recombined into a value in the &lt;em&gt;output layer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This output layer contains the probability of whether the input meets our criteria. If it is above a particular percentage, we might say, “yes” the image did contain a dog. We continue to iterate on our weights until we are satisfied with how often our machine learning model successfully matches our labeled sample data used for training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve used machine learning to create a model to detect if our picture features a chihuahua…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For more explanation, see the YouTube video course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV3ZY6tJiA0&quot;&gt;Crash Course: AI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/WQ8CHKHHzK8&quot;&gt;Photo by Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Finding Patterns in Data is Not the Same as Understanding Data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…or a muffin. It is essential to point out that through all those mathematical calculations, machine learning doesn’t understand what it is looking at; at least not the way we do. It has only identified &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt; where two darker dots consistently appear above one other dot (eyes above the snout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/You-Look-Like-Thing-Love/dp/0316525243&quot;&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Janelle Shane described a similar problem. Microsoft has an image recognition product that works similar to our example: it takes an image and suggests what might be in it. One day, while using this product, Janelle noticed that it was finding sheep in photos that definitely did not have sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After experimentation, Janelle hypothesized that the machine learning model was trained with lots and lots of pictures of sheep in green, grassy countrysides. The model did not “learn” the sheep’s visual properties, but mistakenly correlated the landscape with the sheep label. Subsequently, when Janelle gave the model pictures of sheep in cars or livings rooms, the model labeled the animals as dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image from the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/chihuahua-or-muffin-my-search-for-the-best-computer-vision-api-cbda4d6b425d/&quot;&gt;Chihuahua or Muffin?&lt;/a&gt;’ tutorial.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Strategically Important to Companies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, machine learning is still &lt;strong&gt;a very big deal™&lt;/strong&gt; for companies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-governance-support-innovation&quot;&gt;According to an Accenture global research survey&lt;/a&gt;, 85% of business leaders expect AI to open up new products, services, business models, and markets. Another 78% expect AI to disrupt their industry in the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a report from market research firm Tractica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top500.org/news/market-for-artificial-intelligence-projected-to-hit-36-billion-by-2025/&quot;&gt;forecasts that the annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will grow from $643.7 million, in 2016, to $36.8 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a 57-fold increase and makes AI the fastest-growing segment in the IT sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, AI &lt;em&gt;is not coming to take our jobs&lt;/em&gt;. As the quote from Mary Gray says, automation doesn’t eliminate jobs; it changes the form those jobs take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning is Good at Specific Things&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning promises to lower costs and produce better outcomes. It’s because AI can recognize subtle patterns in vast volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton professor Arvind Narayan created an excellent presentation late last year, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf&quot;&gt;How to Recognize AI Snake Oil&lt;/a&gt;”. He identifies where machine learning techniques are practical, where they have problems, and where they may be ethically dubious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing or scaling perception is a great application of machine learning. These have clear success criteria; either the model successfully does a thing or needs additional training. Automating judgment, or asking a machine to call balls and strikes when there is some gray area, is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s predicting the future. You may use a machine learning algorithm to review someone’s social media feed and identify how often a beer bottle is pictured. That is perception. Assuming that a high percentage of beer bottle appearances makes an individual unfit for employment is predicting an outcome. That is problematic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/30/ai-is-bad-at-predicting-gpa-grit-eviction-job-training-layoffs-and-material-hardship/&quot;&gt;as research has shown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Machine learning, despite its promise, cannot tell the future.&lt;/strong&gt; It can only find correlations in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;However, Machine Learning is Not a Silver Bullet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to use common sense when considering machine learning. Martin Zinkevich is a research scientist at Google and author of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf&quot;&gt;Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering&lt;/a&gt;”. He urges several useful heuristics when evaluating whether machine learning is appropriate for a task, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If your system has more than 100 nested if-else [statements], it’s time to switch to machine learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine you’re a smartphone developer, and you’re tasked with recommending the next application someone should use. You could consider the time of day, the weather, user movement, sentiment of their social media accounts, their text and call volume, the proximity of that communication in a social graph, etc. Those could all be inputs to a complex model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could recommend the most frequently used apps. If a simple heuristic, like “recommend the most recently used items”, is successful 70% of the time, any model built has to significantly outperform it to justify the increased complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Challenges Title Screen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What form does that complexity take? Let’s talk about the challenges to developing machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are Challenges&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four big challenges to creating successful machine learning models. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The volume of data to collect and refine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The compute cost to process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regulatory, privacy and/or ethical concerns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operationalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let’s talk about Google’s Meena chatbot. A sample conversation between Meena and a human is shown in the slide. Google used &lt;strong&gt;341GB&lt;/strong&gt; of text to train the model. In doing so, &lt;strong&gt;they consumed $1.4 million in cloud computation&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s a lot of money. It is also a lot of power. For comparison, it would take the average American household  &lt;em&gt;28 years&lt;/em&gt; to burn the same 292,912 kWh of power. I might argue that the conversation is not noticeably better than Eliza, a program crafted at MIT in the 1960s. As such, there is an ethical question of whether the results warrants that level of energy expenditure (and subsequent carbon footprint).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s before we even get to operationalization and the challenges of doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html&quot;&gt;Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(More on Meena from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-meena-advances-the-exquisite-banality-of-chat-bots/&quot;&gt;ZDNet article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Building Your Own AI Models Can Be Expensive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please consider where the compute for your models is being run. If the training can be done anywhere, research which AWS regions carbon offset, for example. For reference, that is &lt;strong&gt;not US-EAST-1&lt;/strong&gt;. If the training is geographically agnostic, take a few minutes and click the necessary boxes to a configuration more carbon friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Articles pictured in this slide include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.co m/s/613630/training-a-single-aimodel-can-emit-as-much-carbonas-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/&quot;&gt;Training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614700/the-computing-power-needed-to-train-ai-is-now-rising-seven-times-faster-than-ever-before/&quot;&gt;Computer power needed is rising seven times faster than ever before&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide15.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Building on Other's Work Is Important&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, consider building upon others work. It may be hard to remember, but there was a time when the idea of having a picture of every single inch along every single street in every single place was a problem of seemingly infinite scale. Imagine if every application with a street view had to stand-up and operate their own fleet of vehicles and cameras. Yet today, anyone can call a Google Maps API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we aren’t that far removed when small and mid-sized businesses maintained their server closets. Handling things like seasonal traffic or DDS attacks was an individual challenge. Now we have APIs on cloud-providers, like AWS, to call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, imagine if every application that wanted to send a text message had to negotiate individual deals with each and every telco provider? The barriers to innovation would be horrible. Better to let someone like Twilio do that once, and then we build upon the abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that these companies have exposed services via APIs, the future very much looks like leaving the big, precarious, and expensive data collection and model building to the experts. Then we consume that model through an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Enter APIs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs are an &lt;em&gt;enabling technology&lt;/em&gt;. AI doesn’t reduce or eliminate the need for APIs. &lt;strong&gt;More AI use demands more sensible and well-designed APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;APIs Provide an Abstraction to Technical Complexity&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web API (or Net API) provides a &lt;em&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/em&gt;. You have your code. You focus on uniquely solving your business problem. Then, through an API, you consume someone else’s generated model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI provider handles the tricky issues of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collecting and Refining the Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paying the electricity bill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fielding regulatory inquiries around privacy and security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing the operationalization of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Language is the Most Used AI Accessed Through APIs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the industry already moving in this direction. The chart shown was created from a survey of which types of functionality were consumed via API. Things like natural language processing are highest on the list, for the reasons that Princeton’s Arvind Narayan pointed out: these are all perception related. Scaling perception is where AI has proven its usefulness and we’re moving toward a commodification of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Chart from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistic
s/1069198/worldwide-ai-machine-learning-api/&quot;&gt;Statista.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI API Claims Require Data Questioning&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing between AI offerings via an API, it will be necessary for consumers to evaluate their claims via intelligent questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis is a data scientist and writer out of Philadelphia. In her essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the&quot;&gt;Neural nets are just people all the way down&lt;/a&gt;”, Vicki highlights some important revelations on one highly-touted AI use case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“if you’re doing image recognition in 2019, it’s highly likely you’re using an image recognition systems built by images tagged by people using Mechanical Turk in 2007 that sit on top of language classification systems built by graduate students prowling newspaper clippings in the 1960s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much we should be asking about our AI providers. However, briefly, consider the incentives. Be wary if there are financial incentives to be less than transparent about how the model is generated or where the data is collected from. Also, be skeptical if an AI product also happens to use the latest blockchain-enabled, agile-Kubernetes, nano-service hype salad. Leverage others’ work, like this article comparing cloud providers; not all pieces are this comprehensive, but there are folks out there that are sharing their results for the community’s benefit. And, finally, interrogate the data. In general, we’re not good at this, in general, but, going-forward it will increasingly be more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles pictured in this slide include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/learn-the-red-flags-ofoverhyped-ai-claims&quot;&gt;Three easy ways to evaluate AI Claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/comparing-machine-learning-as-a-service-amazon-microsoft-azure-google-cloud-ai-ibm-watson/&quot;&gt;Comparing Machine Learning as a Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dataset Nutrition Labels Need Our Support&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey was done asking folks whether they had practices in place to determine whether their data was good. Unfortunately, 44% said ‘no’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, that is not going to be an acceptable answer. We need to figure out best practices to interrogate the data. This is especially true of APIs since we may not have our hands on that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the same survey, a majority of respondents reported that their ability to analyze data was self-taught. Going forward, we will need standardized, reusable approaches to create standardized, predictable results. As proposed in the linked white paper, one idea is using a nutritional label-like representation to compare and contrast datasets used in AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting a dataset nutrition label &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help. However, keep in mind that having a robust understanding of the data is only one part of the process necessary to create a working model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Charts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1805/1805.03677.pdf&quot;&gt;The Dataset Nutrition Label Whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide21.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Conclusions&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot and, again, I’m only showing the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide22.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Where to Learn More&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more, there are numerous placed to get started. In addition to the many papers, presentations, and courses that I’ve linked to throughout this talk, I would also recommend the following books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/you-look-like-a-thing-and-i-love-you-how-artificial-intelligence-works-and-why-it-s-making-the-world-a-weirder-place/9780316525244&quot;&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You&lt;/a&gt; by Janelle Shane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/rebooting-ai-building-artificial-intelligence-we-can-trust/9781524748258&quot;&gt;A Human’s Guide to Machine Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; by Kartik Hosanagar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/rebooting-ai-building-artificial-intelligence-we-can-trust/9781524748258&quot;&gt;Rebooting AI&lt;/a&gt; by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I would highly encourage those working in the space to have a firm grasp of how these algorithmic approaches can cause harm. For that, I would suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy/9780553418835&quot;&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction&lt;/a&gt; by Cathy O’Neil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/automating-inequality-how-high-tech-tools-profile-police-and-punish-the-poor/9781250215789&quot;&gt;Automating Inequality&lt;/a&gt; by Virginia Eubanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also surprises me that there aren’t more sites that allow prospective AI users do “comparison shopping” across the major providers. Algorithmia &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be an online marketplace for algorithms. Similarly, Inten.to &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to allow running sample queries across cloud algorithms. Both appear to have since pivoted. Certain AI APIs can still be found within the Programmable Web directory, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple good sources for data, if people are looking for raw ingredients to get started. If you are aware of other sites that provide a similar service, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2021/01/Slide23.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;How to Contact Me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and attention. My name is Matthew Reinbold and you can find me online at these fine establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Shared Road</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From an individual API producer’s perspective, adherence to an enterprise company’s design style guide may seem puzzling. “Why do we have to learn these naming conventions?” they’ll ask. Other questions include, “What difference does our style of versioning make?” or “Why can’t we use the authentication scheme that worked at my previous company?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, I did a series of “Back to Basics” roadshows for my day job. According to various surveys, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerlife.co/blog/san-francisco-large-corporation-employee-tenure&quot;&gt;the average developer tenure at any company is between one and two years&lt;/a&gt;. My goal, through the roadshows, was to re-establish the principles that have guided our five-year-old program. I’ve used urban planning stories before, whether that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2015/05/12/APIsandGovernance/&quot;&gt;Brazillian Favelas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/net-api-notes-for-2020-01-24-mailbag-issue-119&quot;&gt;Paris’s tree-lined boulevards&lt;/a&gt;. To justify the need for enterprise standards for a degree of design consistency, I used a traffic regulation analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of it because of the most recent Postlight podcast, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://postlight.com/podcast/restricting-freedom-for-more-freedom-on-the-parallels-between-wearing-a-mask-and-regulating-tech&quot;&gt;Restricting Freedom for More Freedom: On The Parallels Between Wearing a Mask and Regulating Tech&lt;/a&gt;”. In that show, hosts Paul Ford and Rich Ziade discuss people treating mask requirements during Covid-19 as a violation of constitutional rights (spoiler: &lt;em&gt;they’re not&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes inconveniencing the individual is the best for the larger group. That goes for whether we’re talking about masks, software governance, or traffic. Below a snippet of my argument from that “Back to Basics” deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/08/road.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Road Forward&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modern-software-architecture-is-complex&quot;&gt;Modern software architecture is complex&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Ousterhout, in his book “A Philosophy of Software Design”, defines complexity as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“-anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a barrier to the kind of business agility that we crave, that is needed to win in competitive marketplaces, is how hard our architectures are to grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;message-passing-hides-complexity-behind-an-interface&quot;&gt;Message Passing Hides Complexity Behind an Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message passing is a means of abstracting complexity and hiding behind an interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That abstraction allows programmers to work on a system without being exposed to all a system’s complexity at once. An API is a simplified view that omits unimportant details (or at least those details unimportant to the API’s consumer). It makes it easier for us to think about and get stuff done in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-faster-and-high-quality-are-not-diametrically-opposed&quot;&gt;“Going Faster” and “High Quality” Are Not Diametrically Opposed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Going faster” is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a matter of getting rid of the rules. Martin Fowler,  elegantly states to the contrary, that this is a false trade-off. In his piece, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html&quot;&gt;Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost?&lt;/a&gt;” he outlines how quality efforts, over time, translate to great speed for the entire system over any individual’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality-design-is-a-financial-imperative&quot;&gt;Quality Design is a Financial Imperative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-quality design, while quick to make, incurs a lifetime tax. Maintenance is harder, requires additional overhead, and compares less favorably in the marketplace. Quality is not a moral argument, something that makes our inner artisan feel good. Quality design is a financial imperative to increase our software return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Key to Writing Less code and causing less rework is to write better abstractions” - Eric Elliot, &lt;em&gt;distributed systems expert and author&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-need-continual-renewal-and-reflection-on-what-quality-means-for-us&quot;&gt;We Need Continual Renewal and Reflection on What Quality Means for Us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why it is essential that each of us, whether we are product managers, architects, or engineering leads, continually renew our understanding and application of basic core principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A garden is not something that you plant in the spring and wander away from. The ability to reap what was sown requires constant attention and care. We have to rededicate ourselves to executing on the fundamental, basic things before overcoming complexity is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-road-is-shared&quot;&gt;Our Road is Shared&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the most basic thing, the first principle - the one to remember if you remember nothing else - is that we’re in this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is only one car on the road, then the fastest way to get from point A to B is to ignore all speed limits, go whichever way they want on one-way roads, and view all traffic signage as optional. From their perspective, an individual team will wail and gnash their teeth at how much faster they could get to production if they were only allowed to do whatever they want. Imagine the freedom(!!!)… for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is not a single team. There are hundreds on their journeys, crisscrossing each other and going to and fro. Things like speed limits, lane markings, stop signs, and traffic signals are all there to move the most people to the greatest number of places, safely. We exist within a system. The road we travel is shared between us. If we are going to arrive, it will be through minor, in-the-moment, inconveniences made for the larger, more-long-lasting, good of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~fin~&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Technology Aphorisms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was talking to another professional with decades of technology experience. When I dropped a reference to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bike-shedding&quot;&gt;bike-shedding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I was met with a blank stare. Given he had never heard of the reference, much less know the difference between that and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#yak-shaving&quot;&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I decided something had to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over my professional career, I’ve collected numerous pithy statements about technology. Some of these aphorisms are serious; others, not so much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2018/04/eponymous-laws-of-tech/&quot;&gt;But folks seem to find these things useful&lt;/a&gt;. Internalizing may not make you a better technologist. However, the next time you’re stuck, you’ll know you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/08/yak-shaving.png&quot; alt=&quot;A parody O'Reilly book cover for Yak Shaving.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Yak Shaving. The definitive guide.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the aphorisms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ashbys-law&quot;&gt;Ashby’s Law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#baader-meinhof-effect&quot;&gt;Baader-Meinhof Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Leading People in Crisis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/road.png&quot; alt=&quot;An image of the road running to the horizon.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The road ahead.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 7/22&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;At the same time I was posting this, Cassie McDaniel published “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cassiemc/everyones-sad-and-getting-sadder-c8e6b23e69a5&quot;&gt;Everyone’s Sad and Getting Sadder&lt;/a&gt;”. It wonderfully expresses some of that which I brushed past on the way to solutioning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 7/23&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/07/microsoft-analyzed-data-on-its-newly-remote-workforce&quot;&gt;Microsoft has published compelling data on new remote work trends&lt;/a&gt;. Revelations include that “managers are enabling employee resilience through this disruption. Employees across our team saw their work hours spike after the shift. But looking at one-on-one meetings, a key connection point in the manager-employee relationship, we found that the employees who averaged the most weekly one-on-one time with their managers experienced the smallest increase in working hours. In short, managers were buffering employees against the negative aspects of the change by helping them prioritize and protect their time.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being responsible for employees is challenging, even in the best of times. It is something else entirely to care for people during simultaneous health, inequality, justice, governance, economic, and education crises caused by Covid-19. We, collectively, are undergoing a transition to &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;. Like with many transitions, there is discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When stressed, fight-or-flight reflexes engage. Our minds brace for an oncoming challenge. However, with this global pandemic, there is no enemy to overcome and no timeline for resolution. We remain on high alert for an all-clear that won’t come. Further, previously simple actions, like going to the grocery store or getting a check-up, are filled with new and unfamiliar processes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90515519/tech-workers-are-showing-the-effects-of-covid-19-related-burnout&quot;&gt;generate additional micro-bursts of stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re shadowboxing with history. It is no wonder we’re exhausted each evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your team, dealing with Covid-19 is more than just virtual happy hours and disrupted travel plans. Uncertainty breeds anxiety, no matter what your resilience level was going into this year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-be-a-truly-exceptional-leader-neuroscience-says-do-these-5-simple-things-right-now.html&quot;&gt;About one-third of Americans have exhibited signs of anxiety or depression in the wake of Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;.  And anxiety erodes our energy, patience, and ability to absorb new information. It does so, slowly, at first, but this prolonged experience aggregates into significant mental health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’m doing to care for my team during these times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-up-lightweight-check-ins-but-let-them-lead&quot;&gt;Keep Up Lightweight Check-ins, But Let Them Lead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transition requires all of us to process a lot. Even with a great rapport, your co-worker may not have the time, energy, or ability to articulate what they need. Respect your team member’s choice if they aren’t ready to talk. In that case, impress on them that epiphany has no deadline. When they’re ready, you’ll move mountains to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue your regular cadence of check-ins, but let them tell you what they need. Ask a multiple-choice question designed to require as little energy, on their part, as possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Just wanted to check-in. Would it be more helpful to keep our one-on-one today, reduce it to 15 minutes, or skip it? I’m happy no matter what— just want to make sure you have what you need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strike-how-are-you-from-your-opener&quot;&gt;Strike “How Are You?” From Your Opener&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your team member does opt to meet, avoid the weak “How are you?” or “How you doing?” opener. It will, most likely, result in a reflexive “OK”. Instead, prepare questions that will provide additional insight and present more profound opportunities to help. Lara Hogan is a management coach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://larahogan.me/blog/check-in-questions-for-one-on-ones-during-crisis/&quot;&gt;She lists several excellent items appropriate for 1-on-1’s during this time&lt;/a&gt;. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s been working for you so far?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s been the hardest? What’s been the most surprising thing during this time?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s your north star?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s one thing you want to experiment with right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; questions, check out the Elizabeth Weingarten article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/work/1836105/20-great-questions-to-ask-instead-of-how-are-you-doing-right-now/&quot;&gt;20 Questions to Ask Instead of ‘How are You Doing?’&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-present&quot;&gt;Be Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve engaged, apply active and &lt;em&gt;empathetic&lt;/em&gt; listening.  Everyone needs something different right now. Don’t presume to know what challenges are occupying your people’s head space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look into the camera rather than sidelong at yourself in the video. Avoid scrolling through email. Close Slack. Turn off text notifications. These meetings are not to bolster your hierarchical imbalance through the zillion alternatives you could do. This time is about them. Catharsis through connection is possible only through focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not be able to solve every problem. You shouldn’t attempt to spin what you’re hearing into a silver-lining. &lt;strong&gt;And never, never, invalidate what the individual is thinking or feeling the first time they’re attempting to process, out-loud, what is impacting them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-the-cliches-or-false-bravado&quot;&gt;Avoid the Cliches or False Bravado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing hope or expressing wishes for the future is one thing. Inauthentic promises or thoughtless chest-beating will create distance from those who have a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a business management playbook filled with cliches. War metaphors, in a time with unprecedented death, ring particularly hollow at this moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Rally the troops.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Let’s win this battle!”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“This is our fight.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Weaponize this opportunity!”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Who’s killing it?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s OK to admit that you might not have answers for a once-in-a-lifetime event. It’s OK if your team isn’t fired up to storm the beaches of Normandy. Admitting “I don’t know” and allowing oneself to be vulnerable goes a long way toward connecting and creating authentic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offer-positive-feedback-and-encouragement&quot;&gt;Offer positive feedback and encouragement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Rock, who has a doctoral degree in neuroleadership, says Covid-19 has made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-be-a-truly-exceptional-leader-neuroscience-says-do-these-5-simple-things-right-now.html&quot;&gt;people hyper-sensitive to their standing&lt;/a&gt;. Through this filter, normally benign questions are now interpreted as negative or even discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proceed thoughtfully. Instead of asking, “Why is your delivery late?”, which may be inferred as a personal attack, reframe it as, “What’s happening with this project?” It’s not about lowering expectations or letting performance slide. This shift in language is about acknowledging the sensitive spot people are in and reducing anxiety, not making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strive-to-create-certainty&quot;&gt;Strive to Create Certainty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambiguity heightens stress. The more variables you can remove from employees’ lives right now, the better. Lara Hogan has another piece on &lt;a href=&quot;https://larahogan.me/blog/predictability-stability-terrible-times/&quot;&gt;Creating Predictability and Stability in Times of Rapid Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach for creating certainty is sharing information. Sharing helps create certainty and builds trust, even if that news isn’t always positive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/savvy-parenting/201406/when-parents-lie&quot;&gt;Research shows that children can deal with almost any disappointment if provided with appropriate support. However, if children feel that they were lied to, they will act out&lt;/a&gt;. Similar dynamics exist between a leader and their team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accept-were-all-human-in-a-crisis&quot;&gt;Accept We’re All Human in a Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/seven-rules-of-zoom-meeting-etiquette-from-the-pros-11594551601?mod=e2tw&quot;&gt;A recent Wall-Street Journal article called for a return to an idealized professional esthetic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No more dogs, chips or lurkers — as video-conferencing becomes a fixture in working life, it’s time to shed the rookie moves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if everyone had chosen their current work predicament, I’d agree. However, not everyone has the optimized quiet place. We’re all distracted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowingdata.com/2020/07/13/parenting-and-work-schedule-during-the-pandemic/&quot;&gt;doing the best we can with those we’re surrounded with&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;who are also going through a thing&lt;/em&gt;. We’re humans in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-asserting workplace norms adds undue performative expectations on those already struggling. When we feel like we have no control or choices, even a small stress becomes overwhelming. Leaders should offer unexpected autonomy and flexibility. Relax the always-on camera requirements. Or forgive the hastily assembled lunch on the part of a busy parent. And honor those aspects of human experience - delivery person interruption, pets barking, kids video-bombing - that remind us these aren’t just workplaces, but our lives co-opted into a global event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-care-of-yourself-too&quot;&gt;Take Care of Yourself, Too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your employees aren’t the only ones dealing with volatile levels of attention and energy. Your reserves are also being siphoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To best serve them, it is vital you’re managing yourself. That may mean not scheduling the back-to-back-to-back marathon meetings that you’d typically be able to do. It may mean saying no or pulling back on worthwhile, yet not primary, initiatives. It might mean being an example and figuring out how staycations work, not because you need more time at home, but because you’re illustrating how important mental breaks are for the marathon we’re running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships rooted in psychological safety are like an oak tree: the best time to plant them was years ago. The second best time is now. If you haven’t spent the time to cultivate trust, your employees are less likely to share what they’re struggling with. That makes it harder to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that people choose to lead will be remembered for years to come. Some leaders are just trying to command through goal setting and stretching people to their limits. Then there will those exhibiting empathy, making sure that people feel heard and are taken care of for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that latter type of leader.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>APIs are Arrangements of Power</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented “APIs are Arrangements of Power” at the 2020 APIDays Interface conference. It was my first virtual conference and a very different experience. How I prepared for that context is a different article. For now, the slides and script are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Office Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@ayahya09&quot;&gt;Ali Yahya&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-02.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I am Matthew Reinbold&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone. I hope that you and yours are healthy and safe during this interesting time. If there is a sliver of a silver lining to all of this, I think it’s doing things like this gives some extra context and insight into the type of people you might otherwise only interact with online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my workshop and creative space. My name is Matthew Reinbold. As was mentioned, I work for Capital One. I am the Director of the Platform Services Center of Excellence. That’s a lot of words. It means that my team and I work with our 9000+ developers on thousands of APIs that answer 3.5 billion calls a day. It is a large ecosystem that we steward. We’re also increasingly involved with things like standards and processes and training around data transformation and event streaming. It is a role that cuts across the entire company and collaborates with numerous disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also write &lt;a href=&quot;http://netapinotes.com/&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;, a regular, weekly email newsletter that just celebrated five years. There I chronicle the comings and going of an industry in flux. Talking about one API, or even a handful is one thing. The challenge of managing thousands is something different. I’ve seen what it takes to go from API theory to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to find me, along with a hashtag for social media, is in the footer of each slide so we can continue the conversation even after my time is up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-03.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of blog posts, videos, and presentations - some at this very conference - that go DEEP on technical &lt;em&gt;and tactical&lt;/em&gt; aspects of delivering APIs. That is useful. However, many of us who have been involved in the space for a while have realized that just cargo-culting someone else’s tech stack isn’t enough to guarantee success. Just because you’ve implemented all of Netflix’s open-source projects or replicated Amazon’s cloud infrastructure doesn’t mean you’re going to be successful in delivering business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because APIs are more than just technology. It has so much more to do with how an API strategy manifests within the people responsible for carrying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone that cares about creating better, more well-designed software - not just APIs. To do that, we’re going to have to architect people, not only machines. And, in the process, perhaps redefine your expectations of the role API governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-04.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 1: The Power of Organizations on Architecture&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-05.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Conway's Law&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Melvin Conway published a paper entitled “How do Committees Invent?”. He proposed that the way that an organization was arranged directly and dramatically affects how software is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That early anecdotal observation was later supported by quantitative research. It stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizational distribution and product modularity are correlated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Products really do end up looking like the teams that create them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a company has two development teams that rarely talked with one another: one supporting the warehouse and another supporting the back office. If you set out on an API journey, Conway’s Law predicts that the resulting architecture from those teams would consist of two APIs: one for the warehouse, one for the back office. This despite the fact an external 3rd party wishes to integrate with your single company, not your org chart parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-06.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Code Quality&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the organizational arrangement doesn’t just affect modularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It turns out that organizational complexity is also the greatest determining factor for how buggy a piece of code is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more complex the organization is (due, in part, to how removed decision-makers are from implementors) the worse the code is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-influence-of-organizational-structure-on-software-quality-an-empirical-case-study/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Research Study&lt;/a&gt; mentioned here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Delivery Performance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations, published in 2018, cited organization arrangement as a key contributor to achieving delivery performance as well as for whether the engineering organization can scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If we achieve a loosely-coupled, well-encapsulated architecture with an organizational structure to match we can achieve better delivery performance… and substantially grow the size of the engineering organization and increase product lineraly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-08.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Impacts Morale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Topologies is another book dedicated to organizational arrangements. It also happens to be the best API book that I’ve read thus far this year, despite not marketing itself as an API book. The authors agree that it isn’t just getting the technology right. Designing the organization that utilizes that technology is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Never before has explicit sociotechnical design been so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say more on that $5 word, “sociotechnical”, in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-09.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organizational Structure Accounts for 90 or 95 Percent of Performance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W. Edwards Deming was an American engineer and management consultant. He is often credited as one of the inspirations for the Japanese post-war economic miracle of the 1950s. When it came to organizational arrangements, Deming said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fact is that the system that people work in and the interaction with people may account for 90 or 95 percent of performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about cargo-culting, when I talk about those teams that take everything that Netflix has done and jam it into production, when I talk about turning on every toggle in the AWS interface in the hopes of achieving the same kind of success I talk about failure to acknowledge what Deming says. It is one thing to imitate the technology. However, that is such a small aspect of what it takes to deliver value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing better APIs means first recognizing, then addressing Conway’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Three Ways Conway's Law Affects API Governance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this presentation to be additive. I want it to build on stuff that is already out there. That does mean that it comes with a bit of homework if you’re interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2016 API Strat Conference, I presented “&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;3 Ways Conway’s Law Affects API Governance&lt;/a&gt;”. In that talk I gave three different ways the organizational makeup affects the API design. If you are passionate about this stuff, I encourage you to seek that out and learn how hierarchy, geographical organization, and 3rd party lines of communication end up changing the API design in specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-11.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;buffer's story is one of organizational arrangement&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to provide at least one new example, as well. That comes from Buffer. Buffer is a social network management platform. In late 2015, Buffer acquired Respondly, software that enabled social media teams to respond to customers. Buffer’s technical leadership now found themselves managing two monolith architectures. These two products, Buffer and Respondly, were not connected in any way. Despite offering complimentary products, the organization’s arrangement meant there were significant challenges to delivering business value. The organizational communication structure was negatively impacting the ability to provide obvious customer value that spanned both offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, Buffer re-imagined itself as a platform that would support multiple complementary products. The technical team realigned themselves into groups responsible for core functionalities: billing, sessions, centralized storage of a user’s social media account connections. On top of that they reorganized both their architecture and additional teams around customer’s jobs-to-be-done: Publish, Reply, and Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver the most value to the consumer, Buffer needed to change its architecture, which necessitated a change to its organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The buffer story comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://increment.com/software-architecture/case-studies-in-rearchitecting/&quot;&gt;this Increment.com article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-12.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 2: The Power of Architectures On Organizations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-13.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Developers Are Doing Just As Much Work in Building Companies As Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that the arrangement of the organization, specifically how it communicates, impacts how software is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can we go the other way? Can the architecture drive organizational change? Or does it always have to start with the organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis is a data scientist and technology essayist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/p/taking-the-shine-off-the-apple-and&quot;&gt;In her June 6th newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Something happened in the last 30 years where developers transformed from some nerds sitting in the company’s basement, to the driving force of the company itself. Developers now have a lot of power, and, consequently, are doing just as much work in building companies as in building the code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feng shui is a design practice that attempts to use the arrangement of objects to harmonize people in their surroundings. Likewise, APIs are an arrangement of power. Designed with purpose, the arrangements have the power to shape organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-14.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sociotechnical Systems Optimize Both People and Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing arrangements with purpose is not a new concept. The relationship between people and systems has been studied for some time. The field of Sociotechnical Systems Engineering dates back to World War II. The word “sociotechnical”, which I mentioned earlier, refers to the interrelatedness of an organization’s social and technical aspects. It seeks to optimize both the people and machine in order to improve performance and work-life quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a sociotechnical system approach, an API practice attempts to identify the systematic power arrangements that exist within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, these factors can have an enormous impact on the software produced. And yet, if it is as powerful as I suggest, why do we so rarely see this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-15.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;You Can't Out-Tool a People Problem&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to speculate, I would guess that the messy, complicated work with people is something outside of most engineer’s training? Or, perhaps, it is something that is derisively regulated to “the humanities”. Or maybe it is because people are used to thinking about individual pieces, and rarely of a system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasons, given the power that organizational arrangements have to deliver quality code, that is a shame. It is also a vast, untapped area of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donella Meadows was one of the foremost system thinkers. In her both her educational work and book, “Thinking in Systems”, she repeatedly impressed the importance of communication above all else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labour, or technology. It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and to seek the truth rather than seek to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;this is why cargo-culting fails&lt;/strong&gt;. All the importing of another company’s open-source toolkits, their deployment playbooks, and their tech does nothing to address the interpersonal-communication of the groups implementing them. Said another way, it doesn’t matter how silver the bullet is if the gun continues to misfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-16.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 3: The Inverse Conway Maneuver&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using architecture as a beachhead for changing the organization has a name. The Inverse Conway Maneuver is where the architectural needs required for consistent, cohesive design and fast flow are considered first. The organization, subsequently, is built around that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@hkbobfsh&quot;&gt;Bob Fisher&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-17.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Change Happens&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change happens all the time, even to organizational arrangements. Sometimes it is not the way we want it. Sometimes it is not at our preferred pace. But change occurs in ways both tiny and epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apocryphal story of the Bezos memo is one such example. As the story goes, one day in 2003, Jeff Bezos required that everyone create API interfaces for their services. Anyone who didn’t do so would be fired. If that sounds harsh, it is ok; the email ended with Bezos wishing the recipient a lovely day. Kind of a passive-aggressive thing going on there, but it seems to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That change in how the organization communicated among itself set the stage for AWS. The Bezos memo stated that the company needed to change its architecture to take the organization to where it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as head of Amazon, Jeff Bezos had the hierarchical power to declare that kind of change. Where do you begin if you’re somewhere else other than the top within the org?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this is a big topic, and there is only so much I can cover in a 20-minute conversation. The road you will travel is dependent on your context. However, I want to briefly cover two useful approaches in the time we have left. They are (1) &lt;strong&gt;Shrinking the Change&lt;/strong&gt; and (2) &lt;strong&gt;Scripting the Critical Moves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;Story of the Amazon memo told here: https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/&quot;&gt;Origins of the Bezos Memo&lt;/a&gt; are available online)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-18.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shrink the Change&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two techniques I’m covering are from a book I have pictured here, called &lt;strong&gt;Switch&lt;/strong&gt;. I highly recommend it not just for these two approaches but also for the number of illustrative cases it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first technique is &lt;em&gt;shrinking the change&lt;/em&gt;. Upending organizational arrangements might be necessary. But starting with an intent that large will be met with proportional resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, shrink the change and, in the process, you’ll shrink the likelihood that people will say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change an organization? Start with your line of business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your line of business? Start with your program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your program? Start with your team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t change your team arrangement? Start with how (and whom) you communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of this is about the complexity of our daily communication. How regularly do the API implementation teams talk with the primary stakeholders? Are their intermediaries involved? Do groups talk past each other while emailing attachments? Are the same people always at the table? Or are new pathways being forged by the purposeful and ongoing discovery on your part? Are you building relationships in places where none existed before, are new opportunities presenting themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if through informal conversations, &lt;strong&gt;changing access to information is a precursor to those affordances being codified in an interface&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also the first step to organizational change. It can also be as simple as buying someone a coffee or (these days) having a video meet-n-greet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-19.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Script the Critical Moves&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to script the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, especially during a global pandemic, don’t have a tremendous amount of bandwidth for the unknown. We are dealing with unprecedented, low-level, and persistent stresses. The ambiguity of the unknown saps our energy and lessens the likelihood of new pursuits. The appetite for the potentially ambiguous just isn’t there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, providing the explicit, incremental steps for change may be necessary. A level of prescriptive detail lightens the lift for, otherwise, distracted, distraught, and disengaged teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m currently working on with James Higginbotham is a prescriptive process for teams to design bounded contexts. There is an ocean of tips and techniques out there for how to do this already. However, right now, for our audience,  telling people to boil that body of water to find something pure that works for them is too much. We need to script the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are alternatives to what is in the prescriptive plan. Perhaps some of those alternatives might be better in certain contexts. For those that don’t have the bandwidth for that exploration, however, we’re providing a roadmap to get them moving. We’re attempting to make getting started as easy as possible. We’re scripting the critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned the Team Topology book earlier. I appreciated this book because it takes an infinite number of team arrangements and asserts four specific, followable team types. There may be other arrangements. Your mileage may vary. However, for those looking for an example organizational structures, the Team Topology book is also an example of scripted critical moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-20.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Git Gud at the Peoples&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get real for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know changing organizations may not have been what you signed up for when you assumed responsibility for your APIs. I suspect that the reason you chose software development was the hard certainty of 1s and 0s, rather than swishy, unpredictable nature of the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem. We spend thousands of dollars on ongoing training. We accumulate hours and hours of precious time getting certified and accredited. Back when it was still a thing, we even traveled across continents to learn the esoteric ins and outs from others. Yet, when it comes to interpersonal communication, the &lt;strong&gt;thing that we do every day&lt;/strong&gt;, we can’t be bothered to Google improvements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deal with people. We spend our time and budget optimizing machines, but it is the people that matter. It is the people that determine the success or failure of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with people to build a better organizational structure &lt;em&gt;is a skill like any other&lt;/em&gt;. It can be learned, but only when our API designers and architects stop ending at the interface and start entrepreneuring sociotechnical relationships. Your organization’s ability to deliver business value reliably, scalably, in the face of accelerating change depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is not Kubernetes. Change is not a service mesh. Change happens with people. That is why it is time to git gud on the peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-21.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Part 4: Conclusion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-22.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;API Governance is a Sociotechnical Function&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to software systems, many conclude that API governance is a checklist, or a set of rules that must be applied. While the enforcement of common practice on something like an OpenAPI description of intent might be a tactic of governance, it is not a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance broadly refers to who decides what is in a platform’s ecosystem. Said more generally, &lt;strong&gt;governance is a framework for how we choose to co-exist&lt;/strong&gt;. Checking for naming inconsistencies and implementation detail leakage out through the interface is one thing. I’m challenging you to get to a higher level. That level is to be a organizational designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invitation to co-create these arrangements changes the way information flows in a company. Changing the way communication flows is a precursor for changing behavior, and changing behavior is a precursor for changing the organization itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book “Platform Ecosystems: Aligning Architecture, Governance, and Strategy” has a number of profound statements on this area. The chief one is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The architecture of a platform is inseparable from how it ought to be governed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the real power of API governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-23.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Further Reading&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many books in this space. If you are interested in work being done around organizational arrangements and their effect on value creation check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accelerate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking in Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a fair amount written on change management. Many of them are related to individuals but the ones that I’ve listed here can also apply to organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agendashift: Outcome-Orientated Change and Continuous Transformation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More Fearless Change: Strategies for Making Your Ideas Happen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiny Habits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blue Ocean Strategy (the latter third)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/07/power-24.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Thank You for Your Attention&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! My name is Matthew Reinbold. I hope you’re safe. I hope you’re healthy. And I hope to talk with you again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>API Management Questions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020/05/library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Media organized at a local thrift store.&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Organization of digital assets is as important as physical ones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-introduction&quot;&gt;Background Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam DuVander, a Portland raconteur and all-around good fellow reached out several months ago. He was writing an article and hoped I could answer a few questions on enterprise API management. A few of my quotes, along with insight from a handful of others, have since been posted in a piece entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://stoplight.io/blog/api-experts-share-how-to-organize-thousands-of-apis-and-microservices/&quot;&gt;API Experts Share How They Organize Thousands of APIs and Microservices&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choicest bits made it into the piece. However, behind the scenes, I bloviated enough to populate a standalone piece. Here’s the entirety of my replies, tweaked and updated for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions have to do with how companies manage their &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; API portfolios. These are collections that, particularly in the age of microservices, grow at exponential rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q1-how-does-an-engineer-discover-what-internal-apis-already-exist&quot;&gt;Q1: How does an engineer discover what internal APIs already exist?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API architectures are useful for several reasons. Benefits include organizing the complexity of an enterprise environment, allowing for independent deployment, dividing labor, and achieving faster times to market. Despite these advantages, however, moving from monolithic software deployment does cause discovery problems. Where there was once a single mass to inspect, there are now many homunculi to track down and interview. This is a problem, regardless of the development shop size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A centralized API registry for service discovery should be the source of truth. This single catalog not only benefits integrators looking to kickstart new experiences; it also is vital for data and regulatory appeasement (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act&quot;&gt;CCPA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Luis Weir points out in his book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Management-Luis-Augusto-Weir/dp/1787284433&quot;&gt;Enterprise API Management&lt;/a&gt;”, many companies, unfortunately, don’t have this single portal discovery experience. The discovery process, in these orgs, relies on tribal knowledge and shared spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One needs to design the discovery experience, not just for external APIs, but for internal ones, as well. There are many examples, often retold, for excellent external experiences. What isn’t covered nearly as much is the &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; discovery experience. Whether this is a dedicated portal meticulously maintained by a dedicated platform team or a list (or list of lists) of APIs in a spreadsheet, this discovery experience should be managed. Knowledge management is an undervalued discipline; if you have access to talent in this area, &lt;em&gt;use them in creating this experience&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automation-can-take-multiple-forms&quot;&gt;Automation Can Take Multiple Forms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is one portal or many, relying on “good faith” efforts aren’t scalable. Pleading for harried developers to “do the right thing” and “create some docs” doesn’t work. It, at best, results in the same stale documentation that plagues so many company content management systems. The process for data entry to the registry must be as automated as possible. Thankfully, automation is possible through standardized lifecycle management and process enforcement through uniform API descriptions, like OpenAPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to have the runtime gateway environments “phoning home” to a centralized registry. The description of the business intent would be more abstract. However, identifying highly trafficked or critical infrastructure would be a place to start building out more robust management rigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duplication-of-work-will-happen-the-degree-to-which-this-is-a-problem-is-debatable&quot;&gt;Duplication of Work Will Happen; The Degree to Which this is a Problem is Debatable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Continuous API Management (CAM) book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/api-academy-and-new-beginnings-net-api-notes-for-2019-01-31&quot;&gt;by the dearly departed API Academy&lt;/a&gt;, fingers internal API duplication on poor discovery ability. However, in my experience, &lt;em&gt;this is an oversimplification&lt;/em&gt;. Even with a comprehensive catalog of APIs, development teams may seek to minimize their dependencies. This includes other people’s APIs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/12/07/ConwayAndAPIDesign/&quot;&gt;see point #2 in my talk, “Three Ways Conway’s Law Affects API Governance&lt;/a&gt;”). Internal APIs do not have the same market-force natural selection to pick winners and losers. Other sociotechnical systems engineering approaches need to be brought to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-ensure-new-apis-are-consistent-and-meet-guidelines&quot;&gt;How do you ensure new APIs are consistent and meet guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consistency-of-design-starts-with-consistency-of-language&quot;&gt;Consistency of Design Starts with Consistency of Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before consistency can happen, we have to have a clear medium of exchange. The consistency of design starts with the consistency of language. Are the words “policy”, “guidance”, and “standards” all used interchangeably? What about “resources” and “endpoints”? Are “methods”, “actions”, and “verbs” all the same thing? Or do they have different meanings? Observe the language the business uses and create consensus where there is none. This is a foundational activity before guidelines can be built. It is also ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pair-design-requirements-to-organizational-outcomes&quot;&gt;Pair Design Requirements to Organizational Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to understand the organization’s goals. Guidelines are a means of driving teams a particular direction, &lt;em&gt;but to where&lt;/em&gt;? Guidelines without a destination, that don’t drive an organization to a better place, will be ignored. Are new integrations taking too long because of incomplete (or even contradictory) affordances in the interface? If so, we now have an outcome (or perhaps even KPIs) to shape guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enforcement-is-not-an-all-or-nothing-matter&quot;&gt;Enforcement is Not an All or Nothing Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With guidelines matched to outcomes, we can start enforcement. There is a spectrum. One extreme is gatekeeping. This is where an API is not allowed into an environment (development, QA, production, etc.) without ‘approval’ by a company-sanctioned group. This group is responsible for ensuring that guidelines are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation can help here, as well. Tools like Spectral can detect &lt;em&gt;deterministic&lt;/em&gt; rules. These are cases where a team’s design attempts to submit a body as part of a GET operation. However, more subjective criteria, like whether “chAccPwChangeId” is self-descriptive and easily understood to the target audience, may still require human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gatekeeping approach is the simplest to implement and the easiest to understand, particularly in highly regulated industries (to prevent the bad outcomes from happening a sanctioned party reviews all the things). However, this approach introduces an organizational dependency on software development. It also can be discouraging, particularly for those that self-identify as highly-skilled, empowered individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819&quot;&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt;”, presents an alternative approach. Rather than mandating a gate, the intent is to create a desire for mastery across all constituents and then help them get there (this pursuit of mastery better aligns with the self-image mentioned above, and thus, is more empowering). Skewing on this this side means the emphasis goes from up-front prevention to ongoing internal evangelism and a service interaction models by a supporting API team. Successfully deploying, maintaining, and demonstrating effectiveness of this model is incredibly challenging, however. It is why, I believe, I haven’t seen it implemented nearly as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guidelines-are-a-process-not-a-stable-end-state&quot;&gt;Guidelines are a Process, Not a Stable End-State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, any guideline program needs a well-established and continuously practiced feedback mechanism. The market changes, developer maturity changes, and the organization’s goals change. So too should the guidelines change to reflect that reality. The process for continual co-evolution of the guidelines is so much more important than the given guidelines at any one specific point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-should-legacy-apis-be-treated-differently&quot;&gt;How should “legacy” APIs be treated differently?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly unlikely that any guideline or standards process is starting greenfield. Organizational leadership may be surprised by the number of interfaces, and the data exchanged through them, that already exist at the onset of a cataloging effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building a catalog, the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; priority, even above adherence to standards, is being listed. Once listed, an API governance team can begin a process of ‘eventual consistency’ to guidelines. This is where the API is discoverable but listed as out of compliance. When the team begins work on the next &lt;em&gt;breaking&lt;/em&gt; version, reconciling incompatibilities can also happen since the client will have to modify their code to accommodate the new version &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not fond of “burn the boats”, all-or-nothing transformation initiatives. Even if these “legacy” APIs are not the way we’d do them now, they are still providing business value to &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; (hence their continued existence). Cataloging, with an understood path forward, enables that quirky part of the corporate ecosystem to be studied and understood. As stewards of these complex systems, we’d do well to learn from the complex accretions that occurred. This is opposed to ignoring a company’s legacy to declare a fleeting ideological victory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Roadmap for AI Governance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While AI may be new(ish) for enterprises, the cultural transformation challenges are not. Seeing history repeat, I put high-level roadmap for business leadership and implementing developers on the change that is happening, the challenges, and what successful town planning of this new space looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d like thank Dan Caton, and the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Tential-Tuesday-DC/&quot;&gt;Tential Tuesdays&lt;/a&gt;, as being the catalyst for putting my jumbled thoughts, suspicious, and experience to words on this topic. Presenting at an event with a DJ was also a first. That’s some top-notch hospitality, right there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll also enshrine to the internet archive a heartfelt thank you to &lt;strong&gt;Vicki Boykin&lt;/strong&gt;. She is a data scientist and the author of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://vicki.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Normcore Tech email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Vicki was kind enough to provide a health dose of context to my more tenuous connections. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you, Vicki&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, onto the show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Matt Noble on Unsplash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Agenda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I am going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why this is a critical juncture for a particular type of AI, called &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;, in business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List where machine learning application creates risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present a roadmap for the ground that should be covered by a company’s AI governance program&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Briefly discuss how to get started, and who should do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide3.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Why is Matthew Reinbold talking about AI?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthew Reinbold and, for the past half-decade, I have helped multiple fortune 500 companies create more fair, equitable, and empowered knowledge communities. I create &lt;em&gt;software governance&lt;/em&gt; that empowers &lt;em&gt;digital transformation&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve found myself situated a unique intersection of business strategy, distributed architecture, and internal developer evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my career building developer communities of practice. I also continue to do a fair amount with APIs. In addition to blogging at my website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com&quot;&gt;https://matthewreinbold.com&lt;/a&gt;, I write an email newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/archive&quot;&gt;Net API Notes&lt;/a&gt;. I curate a list of in-person events for API folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapi.events/&quot;&gt;Web API Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/libel_vox&quot;&gt;wholesomely Tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/what-everyone-gets-wrong-about-change-management&quot;&gt;Between 60-80% of software transformation efforts fail&lt;/a&gt;. With my help, however, Capital One embraced an API platform concept, going from zero to 3.5 billion daily messages passed. My team and I did this while maintaining design consistency and cohesion, maximizing lifetime ROI and minimizing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating a thriving culture of APIs at Capital One, I generalized my approach for any digital modernization effort within an enterprise. As I assess upcoming challenges successfully building a data-driven culture, one in which machine learning can thrive, is a big one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide4.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Wild West Ghost Town&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Wardley is a researcher for the Leading Edge Forum. He popularized the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html&quot;&gt;Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners&lt;/a&gt;. It is a way of thinking about technology adoption within a company. Briefly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pioneers&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name implies, discover uncharted territory. Their work is precarious, and they take numerous wrong turns along the way. This is deep research, hard to explain, and harder to understand. However, this is the work that leapfrogs what is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlers&lt;/strong&gt; follow the pioneers, taking chance encounters and precipitous routes and creating repeatable, predictable certainty. They turn prototypes into products and products into profits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Town Planners&lt;/strong&gt; take what is settled and grow it. They scale communities and provide the stable launching points for the next group of pioneers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wild west of high-end research labs is giving way to the more humdrum of daily application and tedious ROI discussions. And that transition is causing some discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide5.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Inflection Point with AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime you combine immense potential, technical complexity, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; cultural discomfort, you end up with headlines like these. It is telling when my 91-year-old Grandfather’s is scared about AI destroying mankind, due to the technical nihilism in his daily reading. Whether it is Elon Musk declaring the end of humanity or the Pope discussing Clippy’s mental state, many pixels have been burned hypothesizing the wild west we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s anxiety we’re on the verge of losing control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide6.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Title Slide&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can talk about practical, town planner solutions, I first need to ground our conversation. That means addressing the ad-driven, click-bait hysteria around AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, Skynet and Terminator-style robots are not imminent. The kind of general-purpose AI that we would recognize as “intelligent”, capable of comprehension and not just pattern matching, is still a significant way off. I highly recommend the book, shown here, by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis. In “Rebooting AI”, the authors do an excellent job pointing out where hyperbole has outstripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index&quot;&gt;h-indexes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have time for a book, Kevin Kelly posits some of the same arguments in his 2017 article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/&quot;&gt;The Myth of Superhuman AI&lt;/a&gt;”. There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/learn-the-red-flags-of-overhyped-ai-claims&quot;&gt;the IEEE’s article, ‘3 Easy Ways to Evaluate AI Claims’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/perception-social-outcome-slide.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI Has Promise In Specific Areas&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton’s Arvind Narayan also published a wonderful talk entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf&quot;&gt;How to Recognize AI Snake Oil&lt;/a&gt;”. I’ll leave exploring the entire piece as an exercise for the audience. However, I will steal his slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvind correctly identifies that AI used in the pursuit of perception and classification is getting better, and useful in a number of business contexts. Where there is trouble is when companies conflate classification with &lt;em&gt;predicting social outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide7.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Machine Learning has Moved from Theory to Practice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a form of &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt; AI, one which uses statistics to find patterns in data. The reason we’re feeling the impact in the areas of perception and classification now is because of the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater ability to collect, store, and study data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased comfort utilizing and scaling cloud compute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recent breakthroughs creation and tuning of neural networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide8.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There will be Winners and Losers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need to be data-driven to compete in an increasingly fast-paced, complex market successfully. &lt;a href=&quot;http://accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-governance-support-innovation&quot;&gt;According to an Accenture global research survey&lt;/a&gt;, 85% of business leaders expect AI to open up new products, services, business models and markets, while 78% expect AI to disrupt their industry in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, companies that are first to harness and apply data to business processes will experience what is known in systems design as a “reinforcing loop”. Data will create machine learning models, which will have business outcomes that can be measured, which will produce more data, etc. The first companies that implement this loop will have compounding competitive advantages. First mover advantage, here, means sustained leads for as long as the competitive landscape remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the need may be obvious, however, fulfilling this vision is hard. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/02/companies-are-failing-in-their-efforts-to-become-data-driven&quot;&gt;According to NewVantage, seventy-seven percent of companies surveyed report problems adopting big data initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, from the same research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;72% of survey participants report that they have yet to forge a data culture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;69% report that they have not created a data-driven organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;53% state that they are not yet treating data as a business asset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52% admit that they are not competing on data and analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way: pioneers discovered a new place, the settlers demonstrated value, but most haven’t found the town planners to scale this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a data-driven culture, one that can feed machine learning, is difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; Many will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide9.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Continuous Delivery for ML is Emerging&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will attempt the transformation. However, deferring all responsibility for ‘correctness’ to practitioners will result in as many definitions of ‘correct’ as their are people in the org. Companies need to think more holistically about how they approach AI in general, and machine learning, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just managing the assets used to create a model, for example, is challenging. A successful machine learning model is &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43146&quot;&gt;As a research paper from Google points out&lt;/a&gt;, technical debt in these systems arises not from code complexity, but from data dependencies, model complexity, reproducibility, testing, monitoring, and dealing with changes in the external world. Further, a business should be able to release new models into production at any time. It may not be necessary to release all the time. However, the ability to do so means the decision becomes a business one, not a technical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have well-understood processes for the continuous delivery of code into production environments; how shops apply automation, quality, and discipline to create repeatable and predictable outcomes. However, packaging and delivering the data, code, and model simultaneously is still an emergent area. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler’s website for more on continuous delivery for machine learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a continuous delivery pipeline not just for code, but for data and models is difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; There will be a lot of failures before we have this figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide10.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regulatory and Ethical Challenges are Growing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as companies believe they understand the landscape they need to be successful in, they discover that the landscape &lt;em&gt;is changing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last several years have demonstrated an increasing societal awareness of data and its impacts. A decade ago, ethics and fairness conversations happened, but they were limited, mostly, to policy wonk circles. Thankfully, that is not the case today and these are above-the-scroll topics for discussion; &lt;em&gt;we are in a different place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States, in response, are creating legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act. Before that was the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. I’d wager we aren’t done with these yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Successfully navigating the growing regulatory regimes and changing societal moors is difficult&lt;/strong&gt;. There will be some high profile failures (and even some unintended consequences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules&quot;&gt;as we’re learning in light of the FTC COPPA fallout amount YouTube creators&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide11.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Done Badly, ML Can Destory Lives&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a machine learning model look like when it fails? Lost opportunities, unjust systems, and &lt;em&gt;destroyed lives&lt;/em&gt;. Worst case, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612775/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/&quot;&gt;described in the MIT Technology Review article,&lt;/a&gt; failed algorithmic decision making perpetuates societal ills. And it does so without clear “bad-guy” to detain and publish. Often, there is little to know accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have written about algorithmic failure, at scale.  For those interested, I’d recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automating Inequality by Virginia Eubanks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technically Wrong by Sara Wachter-Boettcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide12.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;What is a Developer to Do?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to predicting, policing, and preventing all the complex interactions, post-production, between systems machine learning practitioners might not even know about or control. Expecting engineers to be experts in all of these areas is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges with AI are not just a “techie” problem. They’re not just an “analyst” problem. The complexity of this landscape is not something any single pioneer or settler is equipped to address. These problems are a company problem that requires a much broader and more systematic approach to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide13.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Successfully Scaled System Requires a Different Approach&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital town planners are skilled at growing a complex system.  These folks take their cues from urban planning, community organizing, and systems thinking. To solve complex emergent behaviors in software, they eschew causal, command-and-control approaches in favor of dynamic, community driven efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just hire some of these town planners, right? Or, better yet, just tell the folks on hand to start thinking like this and get back to regular work, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Arto Marttinen on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide14.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI Governance?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the potential is great and the challenges well known, then what do companies struggle with this? According to that NewVangage survey I cited earlier, executives state the problem isn’t related to the technology. Rather:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ninety-three percent of respondents identify people and process issues as the obstacle. Clearly, the difficulty of cultural change has been dramatically underestimated in these leading companies — 40.3% identify lack of organization alignment and 24% cite cultural resistance as the leading factors contributing to this lack of business adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT governance is &lt;em&gt;the people, processes, and tools deployed to ensure the effective and efficient use of technology to achieve business goals&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;AI governance&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore, &lt;strong&gt;is a branch of IT governance to ensure the effective and efficient application of &lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt; to achieve business goals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective governance is more than being a bureaucratic gatekeeper, or a barrier between teams charged with delivery and the definition of done. AI governance must address the challenge of culture change. These town planners must bridge the wide world of threats and challenges with the domain expertise of the AI modeler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide16.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Start with Principles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new AI governance program doesn’t have to invent guiding principles out of thin air. The good news is that there has been a tremendous amount of well-researched, nuanced work already crafted and available for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Apple’s Security Principles require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opt-in consent for the use of people’s data for training AI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees, not contractors, to review and label samples used for ‘supervised learning’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nips.cc/&quot;&gt;the NeurIPs conference&lt;/a&gt; encourages the declaration of critical components for reproducing a result be included with any work, including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of models trained before the “best” one was selected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The computing power used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Links to code and dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/&quot;&gt;The IEEE also has a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; available describing a host of ethical considerations in autonomous and intelligent systems&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach-to-ai&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ainowinstitute.org/aap-toolkit.pdf&quot;&gt;AI Now&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) also have some great material available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide17.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;But Success is More than a Checklist&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, successful governance is more than just a checklist of things to do or not do. It must holistically address the entirety of a company’s transformational journey. These town planners shouldn’t just be sharing rules and approving forms. A community of practice can group their activity into three broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Understanding the Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI governance must understand the terrain they operate in; not only the dynamics that shape the landscapes within their own companies but industry and societal forces, as well. Success in this area requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building team amidst ambiguity, as there aren’t many maps for these territories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborating across functional boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the interplay between technology, business strategy, and ethics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying where AI has outsized impact on people’s lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;helping-teams-navigate-the-terrain&quot;&gt;Helping Teams Navigate the Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the landscape is understood, governance must help their fellow employees cross, safely and efficiently. This crossing might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introductory training across the entire company about AI’s importance to the company’s strategy, what it is, and how they can contribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gathering, like an anthropologist, the experience and best practices of people already practicing responsible AI to codify and redistribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empathetic listening to the fears and concerns at all levels, and carving the feedback channels back to those best able to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auditmeasurement&quot;&gt;Audit/Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the list of critical, impactful areas where AI is making a decision, it is then important to have regular, ongoing audit to prevent failures and test fitness. Areas include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inputs&lt;/strong&gt;, like data quality and potential bias in training data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model(s)&lt;/strong&gt;, including statistical tests for model fit (overfitting, causation versus correlation), model transparency (interpretable), and  stress testing against simulated data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outputs&lt;/strong&gt;, listing decisions with explanations, and possible outliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this area, I see a future, emergent discipline. It would be one part data scientist, but another part ethical hacker. They would be familiar enough with the science to understand where the edges of a model begin to break down; things like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06638.pdf&quot;&gt;poisoning just 0.025% of the data can have a machine learning system misclassify the target&lt;/a&gt;. This new job title would stress assumptions made by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide18.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governance has Much to Do&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are broad categories of things governance &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do. However, what might that include, &lt;em&gt;tactically&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-tensions&quot;&gt;Resolving Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AI Governance group could be called upon when two values, seemingly, conflict. An example would be in a business attempting to create a model  for personalized recommendations. Promoting tantalizing, or outright salacious, content might increase the total amount of time users engage on site. However, what if constitutes tantalizing to one group is scandalous in others? Setting the lines here requires clarity and consensus on ethical concepts, and well-understood means for the resolution of these tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/ai-ethics-must-move-beyond-lists-principles-new-report#node-5024&quot;&gt;A whitepaper from the Nuffield Foundation&lt;/a&gt; explore these challenges in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-what-constitutes-a-critical-decision&quot;&gt;Defining What Constitutes a ‘Critical Decision’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors for determining which algorithmic functions have greater risk include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of data was used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What variables were considered?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Global and/or local interpretability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-environmental-impact-targets&quot;&gt;Setting Environmental Impact Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/&quot;&gt;MIT recently published an article&lt;/a&gt; claiming that ‘training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five automobiles &lt;em&gt;over their entire lifetimes&lt;/em&gt;’; this includes even &lt;em&gt;the energy used to  manufacture the car itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a simple linear regression has slightly less performance, could it still be more desirable than an energy-intensive model generation? Who makes the call with whether melting the polar ice caps is an acceptable use of energy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2019-12-13&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08354.pdf&quot;&gt;This recent NeurIPSConf paper makes the case for energy use accounting be a standard part of AI accontability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2020-01-28&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Actionable steps for machine learning researchers should take to reduce carbon emissions include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700&quot;&gt;Quantifying current output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing cloud providers and data center locations wisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce wasted resources through effecient algorithms, good tests, and early debugging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing more effecient hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-creepy&quot;&gt;Defining Creepy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is necessary to analyze data and machine learning for impropriety. However, that’s not the only factor at play. Designing AI-driven experiences require an understanding of where people accept machine intervention, and where people perceive a line is crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in his book, “A Human’s Guide to Machine Intelligence”, author Kartik Hosanagar describes how people may fully embrace algorithms for things like automatic stock management (Betterment). However, they abhor automated systems in things like self-driving cars (Tesla). Why do we trust algorithms in some cases, but not in others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theory is that we’re happy to turn an algorithm onto a job previously performed by &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; (picking stocks) but not something performed by us (driving). While studies consistently show that algorithms may outperform humans, on average, we continue to believe that we are better than average (psychologists refer to this as the “better than average” effect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter of “what’s at stake”. People happily board planes everyday. Airplanes have been mostly algorithmically driven for some time. Yet, somehow, cars remain a bridge too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a capable technology and having that technology accepted by an audience is two different things. Having a group that can identify these issues ahead of a costly deployment, and mitigate them will be important for successful adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide19.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Transparent Collaboration over Coercion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody sets out to make an evil AI. I genuinely believe that the majority of people want to ‘do the right thing’. However, defining “right” and nudging people, as described &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/05/how-to-overcome-clinicians-resistance-to-nudges&quot;&gt;in this 2019 Havard Business Review article&lt;/a&gt;, may not be enough; an enterprise’s best efforts may be perceived as patronizing or subtly manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particular problem for AI practitioners because they possess three common traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A strong sense of purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A desire for autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A commitment to mastery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nudges, to these highly trained professionals, may be perceived as threats to their autonomy or questioning their professional mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is imperative that any AI governance nudge be accompanied by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparency of Purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co-Creation of Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constructive Framing (not just avoiding mistakes, but championing professional ideals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/11/Slide20.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Leadership in this New Space&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effective AI governance, ironically, starts with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ve convinced some of you to take the next step. Or I’ve suggested issues would be best solved collaboratively in your organization, rather than ad-hoc on a team-by-team basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, getting started isn’t clear. Perhaps you feel that you’re “just a developer”. Maybe you assume that you need to be in upper management to create the kind of impact that I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive changes in how organizations create software in the preceding decade are directly the result of bottom-up initiatives. Whether extending experiences and capabilities to the phone, adopting responsiveness through agile and continuous integration, or growing resiliency and ability to scale with the cloud, developers have been instrumental in defining the future of their workplaces. Yet, when it comes to something like how to relate to each other, or how we govern this new area, we hesitate. Or worse, we declare it “not my job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in leveraging the power of machine learning in a just and fair way, and you’re not in a position to issue top-down edicts, there’s still a tremendous amount you can do. Begin &lt;strong&gt;identifying&lt;/strong&gt; those people in your organization using these tools. Begin having conversations and identifying common points of both practice and pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin down the path of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/cultivating-communities-of-practice-a-guide-to-managing-knowledge-seven-principles-for-cultivating-communities-of-practice&quot;&gt;building a community of practice&lt;/a&gt;. If one does not exist, create one. Start with a Slack channel and grow from there. Begin building the momentum to create a demonstrable case to leadership for the need. Don’t wait for someone to get hurt shooting from the hip, wild-west style. Apply the type of town planner approaches appropriate for this new place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visiting Carbon Offset Sites Prior to the Global Climate Strike</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This Friday, September 20th, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;Global #ClimateStrike&lt;/a&gt;. It is a day when millions of people will join youth activists, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future&quot;&gt;Greta Thunberg&lt;/a&gt;, in demanding immediate climate action. This worldwide event comes ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit. To find out if there is an event in your area, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;GlobalClimateStrike.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking to raise awareness is one thing. Taking concrete actions to mitigate our carbon footprint is another. Earlier this year, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewreinbold.com/2019/06/21/On-Travel/&quot;&gt;talked about how I was rethinking my approach to airline travel&lt;/a&gt;. After writing that piece, I signed up for three different carbon offset subscription services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offset.earth/&quot;&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projectwren.com/&quot;&gt;Project Wren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edenprojects.org/&quot;&gt;Eden Reforestation Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one is the best? After several months using each, here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impressions&quot;&gt;First Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all three, &lt;strong&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/strong&gt; has the clearest call to action with cute, cartoony graphics: &lt;em&gt;give money, save the planet&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Project Wren&lt;/strong&gt; is similar, albeit more focused on specific initiative support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eden Project&lt;/strong&gt; is a more “traditional”, non-profit website. By that, I mean it has sections for ‘Mission and Vision’ and ‘Leadership’. It, too, highlights specific projects in various geographical regions. In addition to its reforestation work, the Eden Project also emphasizes the job creation that comes from its programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-signup-process&quot;&gt;The Signup Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offset Earth has the most straightforward signup process. A new individual is presented with three monthly donations options. This “small”, “medium”, and “large” package size is extremely familiar to anyone that purchased freemium or SAAS products on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a toggle for a “family plan”, allowing some degree of customization of the recurring donation size. After selecting an option, some basic name and contact info is required to create an account. Stripe facilitates payments and the overall experience is extremely clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Wren required that I answer several questions about my lifestyle and habits. This was to calculate my carbon report. After presented with the approximate size of my carbon footprint, I was then offered the ability to sponsor one of several projects, each listing its  approximate impact, in ‘cost per ton’, toward offsetting my calculated number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/09/wren-signup.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Sample Set of Questions to Calculate a Carbon Footprint&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eden Reforestation Project has a one-page signup. There are five suggested amounts. There is also options to customize both the size of the donation and whether to make recurring or occur once. Donations can be targeted via a drop-down selector, requiring that you either pick one at random or open up a second browser tab to research each elsewhere on the site. To gauge impact, Eden focuses less on &lt;em&gt;tons of carbon&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it cites “number of trees planted” and “number of workdays created” as crucial metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ongoing-communication&quot;&gt;Ongoing Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;offset-earth&quot;&gt;Offset Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offset Earth users have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://offset.earth/5d33754e2e740f00100f2200&quot;&gt;shareable dashboard displaying the number of days they’ve been offsetting their carbon, the amount of carbon offset, and the number of ‘trees in the forest’&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an illustration showing, month-by-month, how “big” your trees have gotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is cute and makes a good first impression. However, I don’t know if it is something that I’ll continually visit. It also is an  approximation, as I’m told my donations have gone toward wind turbines in Turkey and improved cooking stoves in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emails have been approximately once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019/09/offset-earth-month2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Representation of the Saplings &quot;Planted&quot; Because of My Donations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-wren&quot;&gt;Project Wren&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Project Wren, my monthly recurring donation is used for Amazon Rainforest protection. Thankfully, the site also provides an approximation of the impact this support is having in the form of the total amount of carbon offset. If you wish to go deeper, Project Wren provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectwren.com/footprint/23467&quot;&gt;a personalized carbon report based on information given during signup, with the carbon calculator&lt;/a&gt; (my previous travel patterns profoundly stands out here). Addition actions are suggested based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an email at varying times during the month from “Ben”. It has included news related to the project I’m supporting along with additional calls for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eden-reforestation-projects&quot;&gt;Eden Reforestation Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eden Reforestation Project allows you to sign up for a monthly, recurring donation. Oddly, this does not also create an account on their site. I receive monthly email invoices letting me know my credit card has been charged. I’ve also received a monthly email letting know about their ongoing work. However, it is not personalized; for example, there’s a ‘Donate today!’ call to action addressed to someone that is already donating. The email is also from an entity, not an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the Eden Project was the only site where I was allowed to &lt;strong&gt;opt-out&lt;/strong&gt; of email updates during the signup process. While both Offset Earth and Wren have the ubiquitous “unsubscribe from this list” links in their follow-up emails, I appreciate being given the option from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is the apparent winner? The planet, of course. I can see each of these sites appealing to a different audience. Pick the one that is best for you. You don’t have to be like me, getting my kicks by diversifying my support across many simultaneous initiatives. &lt;strong&gt;But pick one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you’re so inclined, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net&quot;&gt;Global #ClimateStrike&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s turn the &lt;em&gt;climate crisis&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;climate action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
