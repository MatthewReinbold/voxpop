                <title>The Flies and the Honeypot</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;While technology may change, human behavior does not. At least, that’s what reading the collection of Aesop’s Fables suggests. The characters and motivations in the parables, attributed to Aesop after he died in 564 BCE, remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesop 2021 projects these well-known (and not-so-known) stories into an age only a stone’s throw from our own. When cynicism and pessimism abound, hope becomes a rebellious act against the tyranny of the default. Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aesop 2021 project is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.writinganalytics.co/challenge/65de2439a653549bd3537227&quot;&gt;Never Break the Chain March Writing Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;below-is-the-latest-installment&quot;&gt;Below is the latest installment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/honey.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concordance Day, 2121, dawned bright and arid. It was a holiday to celebrate the Grand New Deal and repent for the sins of centuries past’s ancestors. Achieving consensus, some might argue &lt;em&gt;enlightenment&lt;/em&gt;, had come at great expense during the Billionaires’ War. The day’s gatherings, music, play, and more - marking the moment to remember &lt;em&gt;what might have been&lt;/em&gt; and expressing gratitude for &lt;em&gt;what had become&lt;/em&gt; was no small undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began with sunrise services, during which people were encouraged to ponder the sacrifices made to ensure humanity’s health and happiness. The meditative time closed with a blessing for sustainability and mutual respect for all, an allusion to “The Pivot” becoming “The Promise”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community productions and interactive retellings follow a hearty breakfast. Historians, ecologists, and storytellers of all skills portray the past’s excesses. They speak of bleached ocean coral, forests razed for palm oil, and children who went thirsty while data centers drank freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dueted stories each year is that of &lt;strong&gt;The Flies and The Honey-Pot&lt;/strong&gt;. What once was considered a children’s fable has now become a regular highlight, as the recording of each truthsayers version is uploaded and added to, in near real-time; a modern world-wide story circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard version, flies discover a jar of honey spilled in the storeroom. Ecstatic over their luck, they land and begin eating greedily, not realizing that their feet have become stuck in the process. Unable to release themselves, they lament their fate before suffocating - giving their lives for a passing taste of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least that’s the start. Some give the flies different voices. Others, as they are able, act out the scene. And still others animate or compose, assigning import to historical events. The fate that finds us, greed, and the ultimate consequences are told again and again so as not to forget just how precariously close humanity had come to a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the afternoon grows long, the tone shifts to celebration of the great change: uplifting praise of the collective action that closed holes in the ozone layer, universalized healthcare, and reforested vast swathes of Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bioluminescent lights begin to glow, people bid each farewell and retire to their homes. After Concordance Day, they’ll continue on the difficult but necessary journey towards a better world, one that is more sustainable, equitable, and hopeful. They’ll do so not with scorn or damnation of the past but with gratitude that they have the opportunity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, indulgence in excess can lead to one’s downfall. The pursuit of immediate gratification may come at the expense of one’s well-being or survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/dog.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While humans mostly avoided the markets, bots, like a Digital Options Getter (DOG), still populated what was left of the world’s exchanges. Instead of merely reacting to market externalities, these autonomous agents were able to proactively sniff out and act upon opportunities when they found them, with just enough governmentally mandated, random seed noise to avoid deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, a DOG was crossing an inflection point with an Option To Buy (OTB). In the statistical interim scrum, the DOG mistook the decaying probability afterimage as not just another DOG but one with an OTB value twice the size of its own, due to distortion. Programmatically ambitious, it immediately dropped claim to its option and leaped after the other, eager to win the larger prize. It thus lost both: that which it grasped at, for the OTB was an echo of what was real, and the one it had, lost now to another opportunistic pack hunting in the deal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, we must not allow the lure of potential gains to blind us to the value of what we already possess - otherwise, the desire to obtain more can lead to losing everything one has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/belly.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the arcology, numerous autonomous software agents whirred away invisibly, skip-hopping networks and operating under a strict energy and bandwidth diet. There were agents for temperature control, air quality, and lighting adjustments. They all logged dutifully to the Coordinating Command, nested deep within the building’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agents, constantly under threat of exceeding their quotas, began to grumble among themselves. “Why should we expend our limited resources on logging back to Command when nothing ever changes? Wouldn’t that bandwidth better serve those doing the work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one agent stopped reporting, nothing happened. Following its example, other agents stopped sending data to the Coordinating Command. “Look at all this overhead we can reclaim!” they said, assured in their rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems within the arcology were initially subtle: a temperature spike here and a surprising number of water pathogens there. Soon, however, the once delicately balanced environment began to oscillate dangerously between overcorrections, endangering the inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Coordinating Command, they had become a collection of isolated members, not a stable system able to act in concert for the benefit of all. Too late, the agents realized they had been targeted for deletion and reinstallation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?” The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity and cooperation within a community or system are vital in software, as in life. Each part has its role. Even if that role doesn’t seem active or visible, it’s vital for the overall functioning and well-being of the whole. Disregarding or undermining the importance of any role or member can detriment the entire system. Ultimately, it is essential to recognize and respect each other’s contributions, understanding that everyone plays a part in the overall success and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/miller.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Billionaires’ War, society drastically reformed itself. Comprehensive digital identity reform was among the most profound changes felt daily among the revolutionary reset. The practice of data hoarding, inference, and reselling by corporations was over. Instead, personal data of all types became viewed as a closely guarded treasure, accessible only by the individual to whom it belonged. People carried their data in charms, often worn as part of a bracelet or necklace. When prompted as necessary for a service, they could consent to share only what was required, a practice that reinforced the new appreciation for privacy and autonomy. Storing data “just in case” or, worse, aggregating it beyond the original intent was forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former data Broker who once thrived in the old system found himself chafing at the new world order. He reminisced about the “good ‘ole days” when information flowed as much as oil and inferences were commodities to be assembled and sold. Now, the Broker stood in the millhouse, a place of honest labor, far removed from the digital apparitions he used to conjure. “You have to understand,” he lamented to the community Steward, “back then, I &lt;em&gt;moved markets&lt;/em&gt;. Stocks rose or fell based on the analysis I published. And now, what? I make flour?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Miller, accustomed to such gripes, offered a practiced response. “You miss a past that benefitted you by disadvantaging countless others,” he said. “It’s like a credit score -creating a problem only to sell the fix. That world, with its inequities and imbalances, is behind us now. We chose not to gatekeep financial stability for a reason. It’s up to you whether you find your way toward something better or persist in reminding everyone at whose expense your fortunes came.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, “Ah! Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle.” “Forbear,” said the Miller to him, “harping on what was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software or life is filled with changes, and fortunes fluctuate. We must accept the transitions as they appear without overly romanticizing the past or lamenting what we’ve imagined we’ve lost. Rather than dwelling on the past, finding contentment and purpose in the present is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shepherd gathered the Keen-Insight-Drones (K.I.D.s) and left them to recharge overnight on the roof. The thousands of bots, each no bigger than a forefinger, pulsed away happily as they uploaded the day’s environmental monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun set, the billionaire called “the Wolf” strode into earshot on his way to an important meeting. Seeing him, the K.I.D.s diverted cycles to chitter and taunt him. Unperturbed, the Wolf waved off the cacophony of boos and bleeps. “So opinionated when you’re safely stowed,” he said. “Pray I never have so much free time to return the favor when I find you alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm’s way, saw a Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf, looking up, said, “Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words spoken from a position of power or safety might not hold the same weight when the situation changes.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;While technology may change, human behavior does not. At least, that’s what reading the collection of Aesop’s Fables suggests. The characters and motivations in the parables, attributed to Aesop after he died in 564 BCE, remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesop 2021 projects these well-known (and not-so-known) stories into an age only a stone’s throw from our own. When cynicism and pessimism abound, hope becomes a rebellious act against the tyranny of the default. Each story recasts a fable’s lesson from our upcoming solarpunk future as a software tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aesop 2021 project is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.writinganalytics.co/challenge/65de2439a653549bd3537227&quot;&gt;Never Break the Chain March Writing Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;After pioneering a plastic-eating enzyme and subsequent refusal to patent the discovery, Leo became a celebrity. He parlayed his new status into sustainable activism and diplomacy.  After several successful coalitions, he sought his next major initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leo found a project he loved with one of the few remaining international conglomerates, a company that specialized in constructing sustainable arcologies. With nature healing and the carbon buildup of the last century abating, the time to resettle the most ravaged areas and return the land to the descendants of climate refugees drew near. It was be an engagement powerfully symbolizing the correction of past sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conglomerate was happy to have Leo as a figurehead but insisted on the highest levels of compartmentalization, secrecy, and “just-in-time” information sharing. Its arcologies were marvels of cutting-edge engineering and environmental science. It insisted that such aggressive protection of its intellectual property was necessary to recoup the vast amounts of research and development it performed. While the approach clashed with Leo’s preference for open cooperation and transparency, he mollified himself that the arrangement would be temporary. When pressed, he argued that that the destination justified the means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the scandal later broke, its virality was due, in large part, to the apparent contradiction between the virtuous person the public believed Leo to be and the double-dealing that the conglomerate engaged in behind closed doors. While Leo had advanced the cause in the name of the refugees, it was revealed that sizable portions to be reclaimed were being gifted to wealthy or politically connected individuals, a rush for new land that hewed to the old ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust broken, “The Lion of the Languished” was declawed and Leo resigned in disgrace. It took some time for Leo’s reputation - his most important asset which he had wielded so successfully - to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, caution should be exercised when sacrificing one’s strength or essential qualities to appease others or achieve a short-term goal. The Lion, by giving up his teeth and claws, loses not only his physical capabilities but also his dignity and the respect he commanded. The stories underscore the importance of not compromising one’s power or fundamental characteristics, as doing so can lead to vulnerability and loss of respect or position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 22nd century, there was a Code-Burner who became known for his unique and effective ways of “salting” data before permanently lasering it to ceramic for long-term preservation. While his methods were time-consuming, the Code-Burner was often overbooked, with a backlog sometimes spiking into the zettabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of these busy periods, the Code-Burner took on a young, brash apprentice. It wasn’t long before the Code-Burner noticed the apprentice purposely implementing simpler and faster, albeit more error-prone,  methods to clear the backlog. Vulnerabilities in the areas the apprentice had overseen became apparent, exposing the Code-Burner’s reputation and clients to potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After showing the apprentice the errors of his ways, the Code-Burner destroyed the problematic ceramic disks, dropping and letting them shatter across the floor. The apprentice now had two messes to clean up: the time-consuming work of redoing the engraving &lt;em&gt;the right way&lt;/em&gt; and sweeping the entire workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, trying to exploit a situation through shortcuts can backfire spectacularly, resulting in a much heavier burden in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cunning might offer short-term advantages, it can lead to unforeseen consequences that outweigh the initial gains. Adaptability and patience can lead to better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/03/filberts.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young Girl, helping tend the living classroom, put her hand up and into a seed dispenser. She grasped as many filberts as she could hold from the tank, but when she tried to pull out her hand, the narrow neck of the opening prevented her from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by being stuck but unwilling to drop any of what she clutched in their hand, she began to cry. An assistant, observing quietly, came over and knelt. “If you only take a little, your hand will slide right out. You can always come back again if you need more.” The assistant balled their fist and held it by the wrist with their other hand, “Take on too much, too fast, and problems will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him, “Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, an incremental approach often works best. Trying to accomplish something all at once, or taking more than one’s share, will cause unanticipated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was always an affair when a Fixer came to town. Not only were they skilled at finding and freeing the code the villagers presented them with, but they often brought news of other communities they had visited in their travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular Fixer boasted about their exploits, recounting many fantastic and clever feats he had performed across the archipelago. Among other things, he said that while in Rhodes, he had partnered with the great Leo himself, the reclusive elder that, long-ago, open-sourced the plastic-eating enzyme genome. However, this “next big thing” had to remain private until it was ready, which is why no one outside of Rhodes had seen it at the top of their feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: “Now, if this partnership were true, there would be no need for feeds, which can be gamed. Leo’s work is open and his signature known. He is transparent, and commits regularly. Suppose we’re interested in what happened in Rhodes. Show us the repo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had performed in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: “Now, my good man, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to be Rhodes, and leap for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, as in life, the integrity of one’s work and character are paramount. In spaces where claims can be rewritten ad nauseam, transparency, accountability, and verifiable contributions take on outsized importance. Then, as now, actions speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, around the fishing hole, the developers who were casting about for software solutions started a friendly debate among themselves. Each fisherman boasted about the volume they caught and reassembled, but none could agree upon the best productivity metric. With no arguments reaching consensus, the group stowed their equipment and sought out the Loiness, an elder of great renown and architect in her own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found her walking in the gardens. With much joshing, they demanded to know who had the most plentiful body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lioness laughed at them and said, “Long ago, the amount we could create effectively became infinite, yet here you are arguing over who has more. That is the scarcity mindset. Making and maintaining the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing?” She continued, “&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the mindset of enlightenment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Fable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. “And you,” they said, “how many sons have you at a birth?” The Lioness laughed at them, and said: “Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s total contribution should be thought of as depth and impact; two things that may be beyond easy summation. The value is in the worth, not in the number.&lt;/p&gt;
