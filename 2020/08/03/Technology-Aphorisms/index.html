    <p>Recently I was talking to another professional with decades of technology experience. When I dropped a reference to <em><a href="#bike-shedding">bike-shedding</a></em>, I was met with a blank stare. Given he had never heard of the reference, much less know the difference between that and <em><a href="#yak-shaving">yak shaving</a></em>, I decided something had to be done.</p>

<p>Over my professional career, I’ve collected numerous pithy statements about technology. Some of these aphorisms are serious; others, not so much. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/04/eponymous-laws-of-tech/">But folks seem to find these things useful</a>. Internalizing may not make you a better technologist. However, the next time you’re stuck, you’ll know you’re not alone.</p>
